Globally, government lockdown responses to the disease triggered shocks which cascaded unevenly through urban food systems, exacerbating food insecurity. Cities worldwide developed strategies to mitigate shocks, but research on statecraft enabling food systems resilience is sparse. Addressing this gap, we analyse the case of the African metropolis of Cape Town, where lockdown disrupted livelihoods, mobility and food provision, deepening food insecurity. Employing a vital systems security lens, we show how civil society and state networks mobilised to mitigate and adapt to lockdown impacts. Building on preceding institutional transformations, civil society and state collaborated to deliver emergency food aid, while advocacy networks raised food on the political agenda, formulated proposals, and navigated these through a widened policy window. Emergency statecraft assembled networks and regulatory instruments to secure food systems, enhance preparedness for future disruptions and present opportunities for transition towards more sustainable food systems. However, current food systems configuration enabled powerful actors to resist deeper transformation while devolving impacts to community networks. Despite resilient vested interests and power disparities, advocacy coalitions can anticipate and leverage crises to incrementally advance transformational, pro-poor statecraft. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; Resilience; Statecraft; Urban food system; Vital systems security","COVID-19; food provisioning; food security; food supply; livelihood; mobility; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape",,,,,"UID 91490; GCRF; DSI; CHEC","Adelle, C., Haywood, A., Engaging Civil Society Organisations in Food Security Governance in the Western Cape: Reflections from emergency food relief during Covid (2021), Food Security SA Working Paper Series; Akinwumi, A., The will to transform: Nation-building and the strategic state in South Africa (2013) Space and Polity, 17, pp. 145-163; Battersby, J., The State of Urban Food Insecurity in Cape Town (2011), Queen's University and AFSUN Kingston and Cape Town; Battersby, J., Urban food security and climate change.

Cost associated with COVID-19 vaccinations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires rethinking on sustainable funding arrangements to consolidate gains made towards containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Ascertain the determinants of willingness to pay (WTP) for COVID-19 vaccination among adult eligible population in Ghana, and prefer evidence-based policy recommendations on sustainable financing regime for COVID-19 vaccination in the global south. Methods: Setting/design: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted among adult population aged 18 years and above across the sixteen (16) administrative regions of Ghana. Participants: A sub-sample of 697 participants willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was used as the unit of analysis. Outcome measures: main outcome measures of interests were willingness to pay for COVID-19 vaccination and the specific amount respondents were willing to pay. The odds of WTP and specific amount were predicted using the step-wise backward logistic regression and backward step-wise OLS, respectively. Results: A total of 2,107 adult respondents aged 18 years and above were reached out to answer the questionnaire; 1,556 successfully completed the questionnaire, representing 74% response rate. Out of the 1,556 valid responses, 697 said they will receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Out of the 697 sub-sample willing to accept the vaccine, 386 (55%) were willing to pay an average of US$6.00 for the vaccine. Positive predictors of WTP were: being an educated male (OR = 0.55, 95% [CI = 0.366, 0.826], p = 0.004), married and educated (OR = 2.19, 95% [CI = 1.077, 4.445], p = 0.030), being a married health worker (OR = 0.43, 95% [CI = 0.217, 0.845], p = 0.015), and having positive perception of the vaccine (OR = 2.40, 95% [CI = 1.144, 5.054], p = 0.021). High WTP amounts correlated positively with adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols (Coef. = 10.30, 95% [CI = 0.463, 20.137], p = 0.040) and being a health worker with tertiary education (Coef. = 56.339, 95% [CI = 8.524, 104.154], p = 0.021). Christians who are also health workers by occupation were less likely to pay higher amounts for the vaccine (Coef. = -71.431, 95% [CI = 118.821, -24.040], p = 0.003). Conclusions: WTP for COVID-19 vaccination in Ghana is low relative to comparative studies in the sub-region. There is the need for accelerated, advocacy and public education on the benefits of vaccination. Likewise, there should be broader stakeholder engagement and national dialogue on sustainable financing options for COVID-19 vaccination as donor support continues to dwindle for LIMCs like Ghana. © 2022, The Author(s).","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Ghana; Sub-Saharan Africa; Vaccine; Willingness to pay","adult; cross-sectional study; Ghana; human; male; pandemic; prevention and control; questionnaire; vaccination; Adult; COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ghana; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vaccination",,"COVID-19 Vaccines",,,,"Monitoring the building blocks of health systems: A handbook of indicators and their measurement strategies (2010) World Health Organization, , https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/258734, Accessed 2 Feb 2022; (2022) Current Health Expenditure (% of GDP) - Sub-Saharan Africa World Health Organization Global Health Expenditure Database, , https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS?locations=ZG, Accessed 2 Feb 2022; (2012) The continuing epidemiological transition in sub-Saharan Africa: a workshop summary; Alhassan, R.K., Nketiah-Amponsah, E., Arhinful, D.K., A review of the National Health Insurance Scheme in Ghana: what are the sustainability threats and prospects?

Women’s income earning is viewed as a pathway to their empowerment and gender equality. The research goal was to understand how patriarchal socio-cultural norms and practices influence women’s participation in commercial vegetable farming (CVF) in the mid-hills of Sudurpashchim Pradesh, Nepal, and identify the specific and evolving strategies that women use to negotiate these changes. Methodology: Data for the study were generated through in-depth interviews with 16 smallholder couples, eight each in Dadeldhura and Achham districts. Additionally, 17 key informants who were government agency and development organization agriculture support officials at the district and national level were interviewed. Besides in-depth interviews, focus group discussions (FGDs) with women’s groups, women leaders, development actors, and government officials at district, regional, and national level were also conducted. Interview data analysis using NVivo was complemented with field notes, observations and government agency and development organization reports. Results: CVF possibilities initially motivated a few women to discuss with their husbands, organize self-help groups, and seek development program subsidies. With strong support from husbands and parents-in-law, they actively engage in CVF, generate income, form cooperatives for savings and credit, and improve household food security and their own economic status. CVF-associated groups, cooperatives, meetings, exposure visits, skill development training, knowledge sharing, counseling, and advocacy are vital tools. Through them, women build self-confidence, contest and transform entrenched socio-cultural barriers, and negotiate new socio-cultural norms and practices within and outside the household. Dissolving gender stereotypes regarding the division of labor in CVF plays a significant role in encouraging more women to join CVF and increases gender parity. However, a diminishing minority of women still struggle to overcome the legacy of prior negative experiences and subconsciously fear community backlash, especially regarding extended travel outside their village. Conclusion: Socio-cultural practices restricting women’s income-generating roles can be transformed through investment in women’s group initiatives, enhancing husbands’ and wives’ communication and livelihood planning, and community members increased appreciation for women’s role in contributing household income and food security. © 2022, The Author(s).","Commercial vegetable farming; Gender equality; Nepal; New norms; Socio-cultural barriers; Women",,,,,,,"Abdulla, M.R., Culture, religion, and freedom of religion or belief (2018) Rev Faith Int Aff, 16 (4), pp. 102-115; Balayar, R., Mazur, R., Women’s decision-making roles in vegetable production, marketing and income utilization in Nepal’s hills communities (2021) World Dev Perspect, 21 (January); Banu, A., Human development, disparity and vulnerability: Women in South Asia introduction: Incredible progress yet persisting inequalities (2016) New York; Lodin, B., Johanna, A.T., Bullock, R., Degrande, A., Nkengla, L.W., Gaya, H.I., Gendered mobilities and immobilities: women’s and men’s capacities for agricultural innovation in Kenya and Nigeria (2019) Gend Place Cult, 26 (12), pp. 1759-1783; Bradshaw, S., Women’s decision-making in rural and urban households in Nicaragua: the influence of income and ideology (2013) Environ Urban, 25 (1), pp. 81-94; Bryceson, D.F., Gender and generational patterns of African deagrarianization: evolving labour and land allocation in smallholder peasant household farming, 1980–2015 (2019) World Dev, 113, pp. 60-72; (2014) “National Population and Housing Census, p. 2011. , https://cbs.gov.np/, Village Development Committee/Municipality).

By focusing on heterogenous state responses to the 2018–2019 El Niño drought, I demonstrate how the Duterte administration has worked to achieve a violent vision of climate adaptation through a jarring combination of practices: exhorting the devastating reality of climate change; denigrating multilateral mitigation efforts as colonial injustices; subverting indigenous peoples' land rights; and fostering the extrajudicial assassination of activists. Though Duterte's wider climate change policies are often viewed as a strategic distraction or the isolated product of an erratic populist, I argue that these recent responses to climate change in the Philippines, which fuse decolonial and nationalist sensibilities to confrontational forms of illiberalism, should be examined as part of the larger unfurling of illiberal adaptation politics across Philippine history and the Global South. These politics, and their considerable (though far from total) local resonance, challenge both universalist Western political rationalities and new directions in climate justice movement calling for ontological inclusivity. I highlight the need for a closer examination of the origins, practices and implications of violent adaptions. © 2022 The Author",,"adaptive management; climate change; drought; El Nino; environmental justice; environmental policy; Philippines",,,,,,"Bankoff, G., Rendering the world unsafe: ‘Vulnerability'as western discourse (2001) Disasters, 25 (1), pp. 19-35; Bankoff, G., (2003) Cultures of disaster: Society and natural hazard in the Philippines, , Routledge London; Bankoff, G., Storms of history: Water, hazard and society in the Philippines 1565-1930 (2007) World ofWater: Rains, Rivers and Seas in Southeast Asian Histories, A world of water, pp. 153-186. , Peter Boomhard NUS Press Singapore; Beeson, M., Coming to terms with the authoritarian alternative: The implications and motivations of China's environmental policies (2018) Asia & the Pacific Policy Studies, 5 (1), pp. 34-46; Bello, W., Rodrigo Duterte: A fascist original (2017) A Duterte Reader: Critical Essays on Rodrigo Duterte's Early Presidency, pp. 77-91; Blaser, M., The threat of the Yrmo: The political ontology of a sustainable hunting program (2009) American Anthropologist, 111 (1), pp. 10-20; Borras, Jr., Saturnino, M., Franco, J.C., Nam, Z., Climate change and land: Insights from Myanmar (2020) World Development, 129; Bronen, R., Cochran, P., Decolonize climate adaptation research (2021) Science, 372 (6548); Camba, A., The Sino-Centric capital Export regime: State-backed and flexible capital in the Philippines (2020) Development and Change, 51 (4), pp. 970-997; Camba, A., How Duterte strong-armed Chinese dam-builders but weakened Philippine institutions (2021), https://carnegieendowment.org/files/202106Camba_Philippines_final1.pdf, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; Casey, J.P., Duterte vows to end all Philippines mining following disaster.” mining technology (blog) (2018), https://www.mining-technology.com/news/duterte-vows-end-philippines-mining-following-disaster/; Chavez, L., A philippine tribe that defeated a dam prepares to fight its reincarnation.” Mongabay Environmental News (2019), https://news.mongabay.com/2019/11/a-philippine-tribe-that-defeated-a-dam-prepares-to-fight-its-reincarnation/; Colcol, E., Duterte calls on world leaders to multilateralism on COVID response, climate action during east Asia summit (2020), https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/764175/duterte-calls-on-world-leaders-to-multilateralism-on-covid-response-climate-action-during-east-asia-summit/story/, GMA News Online 2020; Corrales, N., Duterte to use ‘extraordinary powers’ for start of Kaliwa dam.” INQUIRER.Net (2019), https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1182774/duterte-to-use-extraordinary-powers-to-start-of-kaliwa-dam; Cortes-Vazquez, Jose, A., In the name of the people: The populist redefinition of nature conservation in post-crisis Spain (2020) Geoforum, 108, pp. 110-118; Curato, N., Ong, J.C., Who laughs at a rape joke?

Alongside politicians, various research and other interest groups have promoted the bioeconomy as inevitable, apolitical, and a triple-win strategy for nature, people, and the economy. Recently, bioeconomy is also actively promoted and framed as transformative. Yet what is transformative or even new in the EU bioeconomy policy, and why is it important to critically engage with the concept of bioeconomy, especially but not only in the so-called Global South? To address these questions, we revisit the discursive field of the bioeconomy, outlining two dominant yet opposed visions that focus on economic growth and planetary limits respectively. We term them ‘pro-economic growth’ and ‘pro-planetary limits’ bioeconomy visions. Drawing on the literature and our own empirical research in market-based, ‘green’, ‘climate friendly’, and ‘bio-based’ economy policy approaches and initiatives, we highlight the EU bioeconomy's embeddedness in colonial and neocolonial logics of domination and green extractivism. While our examples are drawn from the Global South they connect and resonate with the wider European bioeconomy project. We argue that the existing EU bioeconomy visions are poorly suited to address multidimensional and intertwined existential and civilisational challenges, including overconsumption, extractivism, and global socioecological inequalities and injustices. Employing the decolonial environmental justice, feminist political ecology and degrowth literature we outline the missing narratives, ideas and logics and their potentials for fundamental and systemic change in and beyond the bioeconomy project. Finally, we highlight gaps in policy and research that warrant further attention, including: self-reflexivity in identifying policy problems and solutions; historical contextualisation of the EU's role in global environmental governance; silencing and (mis)representation; and reprioritisation of multiple existences and life-supporting practices, together with the relevant epistemologies and ontologies that support them. © 2022 The Authors","Bioeconomy; Decoloniality; Degrowth; Extractivism; Green growth; Planetary limits; Transformations","Economics; Public policy; Bio-based; Decoloniality; Degrowth; Economic growths; European Commission; Extractivism; Green growths; Planetary limits; Research agenda; Transformation; Ecology; Documents; Ecology; Economics; Growth; Interest; Life; Research; Solutions",,,,,"AKA: 332353","Abram, D., Spell of the Sensuous: Perceptual Language in a More-than-Human World (1997), Vintage Press; Acosta, A., Buen Vivir: A perspective for rethinking the world (2020) Degrowth in Movements: Exploring Pathways for Transformation, pp. 87-99. , C.

However, recent phenomena indicate NGOs often acting in opposition to their benevolent claims. This study attempts to move away from the normative concepts of NGOs and develop an analytical framework fitted with the current empirics in environmental governance. Using theories of organized interest groups in a democratic political system, we analyze the extent of NGOs fulfilling their roles as organized interest groups (OIGs), where they should take roles representing the interests of particular groups within societies and exerting political influence on governments on the basis of these common interests. We use empirics from Indonesian forest and environment-related governance, and our framework is called “Representation–Influence Framework,” which assists in establishing more systematic coherent typologies of OIGs. Analyzed from the perspective that NGOs claim to serve as representatives of specific groups within societies, we establish three overarching categories of OIGs, that is, 1) en route to fulfilling the claim, 2) breaking the claim, and 3) opposing the claim. We further detail our framework into a subset of nine OIG typologies. In this way, we provide pathways to begin deconstructing the common simplifications and misunderstandings about NGOs. For empirics, we identified 38 OIGs in the cases of social forestry and timber legality policies and populated them according to the typologies. We found that most of them are en route to fulfilling the claim of representing the groups’ interests, although their political influence on the government is, in most cases, limited. © 2022 by Forest and Society.","Environmental Governance; Forest Policy; Indonesia; Influence; Interest Groups; NGOs; Representation","environmental management; environmental policy; forest management; forestry policy; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; policy development; Indonesia",,,,,"6214/UN1/DITLIT/DIT-LIT/PT/2021","Afiff, S.

This article argues that in order to support local decision-making on food systems and agricultural aid, international solidarity work should look towards food sovereignty and agroecology approaches. Food sovereignty and agroecology, informed by feminist approaches, can provide important lessons for localization as they prioritize local knowledge and decision-making, and are based on social justice principles. They also provide alternatives to the problematic concept of “development”, particularly the agro-industrial development model which contributes to environmental and health crises, corporate concentration, colonialism and inequality. An example of the trajectory of the NGO SeedChange is provided to help illustrate how food sovereignty can: (1) provide an alternative to problematic development concepts, and (2) encourage localization and greater priority to global South perspectives. While acknowledging that there exist contradictions and challenges to shared decision-making, learning from partners in the global South working for seed and food sovereignty has been crucial to shaping the organization’s programs and policy advocacy. © 2022 by the authors.","agroecology; development; food sovereignty; localization; NGOs",,,,,,,"Esteva, G., Development (1992) The Development Dictionary: A Guide to Knowledge as Power, pp. 1-23. , Sachs W., (ed), Zed Books, London, UK; Ferguson, J., Development (2002) Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology, pp. 154-160. , Barnard A., Spencer J., (eds), Routledge, London, UK; (2020) Topsy-Turvy World: Net Transfer of Resources from Poor to Rich Countries.

Therefore, this study examines the cooking space of the Global South with a specific focus on the rural communities to map alternative energy sources, technologies and supporting policies to drive clean cooking services for improved socioeconomic development. It begins with a literature review on clean cooking technologies and clean energy access for the Global South, which leads to the suggestion of clean cooking policies by mapping technology, affordability, accessibility, climate action, business model and local capacity. In order to ensure that the validation is appropriate, three online questionnaires were designed to capture three categories of key stakeholders with distinctive and complementary interests in clean energy access for cooking: (i) End-users, (ii) Energy Suppliers and (iii) Interest Groups in rural communities in Fiji, Ghana and Nigeria. The responses are analysed to conduct a comparative study across the three countries examined. Based on the above, an attempt is made to present broad base policy pathways for adopting clean cooking services in the rural community for sustainable development. The policy pathways harmonize the major stakeholders in the cooking space: Governments, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), clean energy developers, business services and the end-users. In addition, a business model in the context of a rural community cooking space is proposed, stating that the initial life of the clean cooking business should be government-driven and, thereafter, followed by incentive-driven at the mid-life of the business (say, 25% technology penetration) and private-sector-driven at the late-life (say, 45% technology penetration). It is expected that the effort made in this work could be advanced by investigating the detailed techno-economic parameters of clean cooking technologies that could be influenced by the policy pathways established in connection with the sociocultural factors associated with energy services. © 2022 by the authors.","business model; clean cooking; clean technology mapping; cooking technologies; energy poverty; policy development","alternative energy; comparative study; energy policy; energy resource; mapping method; policy development; poverty; rural population; stakeholder; sustainability; Ghana; Nigeria",,,,,"ACU","Hickel, J., Quantifying national responsibility for climate breakdown: An equality-based attribution approach for carbon dioxide emissions in excess of the planetary boundary (2020) Lancet Planet.

We describe how global health's definition evolved to include language on autonomy, power, and health equity. Specifically, we studied the websites of the twenty-five‑leading national (N = 5), multilateral (N = 5), philanthropic (N = 5), non-governmental organizations (N = 5) in research, health service delivery, and advocacy, and academic institutions (N = 5) within global health to understand their history, places of critical operations, budget, organizational structure, leadership, mission, policies, and representation of the global south. These illustrative examples showed organizational structures and bureaucratic processes persisting unchanged as linguistic changes on equity occurred. We posit that within this global health framework of equity, non-convergence of language purporting global health equity with static praxis is damaging on many levels. We underscore that the epistemological-praxis disconnect creates organizational psychology akin to cognitive dissonance within individuals, particularly among practitioners from the global south. This dissonance perpetuates inequity across global health organizations uniquely structurally impedes decolonization by and in the institutions that promote global health, and undermines the achievement of current goals across the global health system. To truly decolonize global health, researchers must measure and study changes in how organizations operationalize their goals, structures, policies, and administrative processes to address equity and social justice across all sectors of the global health system. © 2022","Decolonization; Global health; Health equity","achievement; adult; budget; clinical article; cognition; female; global health; health care delivery; health equity; human; language; leadership; male; nomenclature; non-governmental organization; occupational psychology; organizational structure; physician; preventive medicine; review; social justice; cognition; Cognitive Dissonance; Global Health; Health Equity; Humans; Leadership; Social Justice",,,,,,"Beaglehole, R., Bonita, R., What is global health?

We highlight the ways in which LGBTQ+ criminalization and repressive legal restrictions impact on the task of evaluating LGBTQ+ advocacy and service provision. Drawing on our experience of evaluating a human rights advocacy initiative to reduce stigma, discrimination, and violence as barriers to access to HIV care in Africa and the Caribbean, we outline principles of practice that evaluators might observe and strategies they might draw on to support LGBTQ+ communities in advancing human rights causes and improving the availability of affirming services in hostile settings. © 2022 American Evaluation Association and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,,,,,"NERC: NE/R001693/1","Arensman, B., Advocacy outcomes are not self-evident: The quest for outcome identification (2020) American Journal of Evaluation, 41, pp. 216-233; Arensman, B., van Wessel, M., Negotiating effectiveness in transnational advocacy evaluation (2018) Evaluation, 24, pp. 51-68; Campbell, R., (2002) Emotionally involved: The impact of researching rape, , Routledge; Chilisa, B., Mertens, D., Indigenous Made in Africa evaluation frameworks: Addressing epistemic violence and contributing to social transformation (2021) American Journal of Evaluation, 42, pp. 241-253; Christens, B.D., (2021) Community power and empowerment, , Oxford University Press; Corey-Boulet, R., (2019) Love falls on us: A story of American ideas and African LGBT lives, , Zed Books; Currier, A., (2012) Out in Africa: LGBT organizing in Namibia and South Africa, , University of Minnesota Press; Currier, A., (2019) Politicizing sex in contemporary Africa: Homophobia in Malawi, , Cambridge University Press; Dasmariñas, J., Schlangen, R., Pushing boundaries: Advocacy evaluation and real-time learning in an HIV prevention research advocacy coalition in sub-Saharan Africa (2021) New Directions for Evaluation, 2021 (171), pp. 31-43; Epprecht, M., (2008) Heterosexual Africa?

Paralympic coverage has demonstrated its pedagogical power to engage public(s) and challenge stigma toward disability. Yet, the Global picture of Paralympic broadcasting is deeply uneven, with audiences in parts of the Global South afforded limited opportunities to watch the Games. Considering this, the International Paralympic Committee has begun to broadcast Paralympic coverage across sub-Saharan Africa with an explicit aim to challenge stigma toward disability. In this article, we draw on examples from research to argue that ideas from the field of Communication for Social Change (CfSC) can add value towards this aim. We begin by providing a brief overview of CfSC before critically examining one of the field’s key concepts – Communicative (E)ecologies. Following this, we critically reflect on the potential of Paralympic broadcasting as a vehicle for social change and disability rights agendas in sub-Saharan Africa. We argue that thinking with CfSC concepts show the importance of a ‘decentred’ media approach that engages with disability community advocacy groups, localised communication activities and practices, and culturally specific disability narratives. © The Author(s) 2022.","Africa; broadcasting; disability; para sport; social change",,,,,,"AT2030","Akindes, G.A., Sports media complex and the business of football in Africa (2017) Routledge handbook of international sport business, pp. 277-290. , Routledge, (., –; Andersson, M., Mediatization from below (2017) Dynamics of mediatization.

We offer a review of existing peer-reviewed literature and draw attention to the scarcity of scholarly work on human rights advocacy evaluation in the Global South. The lack of published material in this area is concerning, given the urgent need for human rights advocacy in the Global South and the difficulties of conducting advocacy in contexts in which fundamental human rights are often poorly protected. Based on the review of the literature and our professional experiences in human rights advocacy evaluation in the Global South, we identify themes in the literature that are especially salient in the Global South and warrant more attention. We also offer critical reflections on content areas not addressed in the existing literature and conclude with suggestions as to how activists, evaluators, and other stakeholders can contribute to the development of a field of practice that is responsive to the global challenge of advocacy evaluation. © The Author(s) 2022.","advocacy; advocacy evaluation; cultural responsiveness; underrepresented groups",,,,,,,"Adams, J., Hillier-Brown, F.C., Moore, H.J., Lake, A.A., Araujo-Soares, V., White, M., Summerbell, C., Searching and synthesising “grey literature” and “grey information” in public health: Critical reflections on three case studies (2016) Systematic Reviews, 5 (1), p. 164. , https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-016-0337-y; Almog-Bar, M., Schmid, H., Advocacy activities of nonprofit human service organizations: A critical review (2014) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, 43 (1), pp. 11-35. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0899764013483212; (2019) Laws designed to silence: The global crackdown on civil society organizations, , https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/ACT3096472019ENGLISH.PDF, Retrieved October 12, 2020, from; Amon, J.J., Wurth, M., McLemore, M., Evaluating human rights advocacy on criminal justice and sex work (2015) Health and Human Rights, 17 (1), pp. 91-101; Anderson, I., Northern NGO advocacy: Perceptions, reality, and the challenge (2000) Development in Practice, 10 (3-4), pp. 445-452. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09614520050116596; Andreassen, B.A., Sano, H.-O., What’s the goal?

This paper contributes to the literature on Igor Grossman's concept of wise reasoning and its applicability to COVID-19 management decision-making by political leaders. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employed an exploratory qualitative design. The decision to adopt qualitative method is linked to the paucity of research on wise reasoning, political leadership and COVID-19. The paper draws on qualitative online survey with 42 nurses located in Accra Metropolis, Ghana. Findings: The paper demonstrates that a confluence of research participants perceived the government's act of easing the lockdown restrictions to be in bad faith on account of (1) nonrecognition of different perspectives and viewpoints from stakeholders and interest groups; (2) rising number of cases which naturally make the decision to lift the restriction unwise; (3) concerns about the prioritization of peripheral issues over citizens' health and (4) concerns about limited and robust health facilities and their implications. Research limitations/implications: The key claims must be assessed against the limitations of the study. First, the study is an exploratory study and, therefore, not intended for a generalization purpose. Second, the research participants are highly educated, and the responses in this study are skewed toward them. Originality/value: The paper is novel in seeking to explore wise reasoning and political leadership during a global pandemic such as COVID-19. This exploratory study demonstrates that COVID-19, though devastating and causing havoc, presents an opportunity to test Igor Grossmann's wise reasoning framework about decision-making by political leaders. This extends the literature on wise reasoning beyond the discipline of psychology (the fact that all the authors are geographers) and Global North to Global South since the data for this study are gathered in Ghana. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19;

With the rise in global migration, there is an increasing prevalence of FGM/C among Arab diaspora living in the West and Global South. What remains unclear is how to reduce the practice. This study was designed to identify interventions exerting an effect on reducing the practice of FGM/C. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles was conducted on interventions targeting individuals and/or the broader community to prevent FGM/C within the Arab League and its diaspora, up to December 2021. Databases searched included PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, ASSIA and Scopus. Quality assessment used the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. Results: Twelve of 896 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight interventions relied entirely on education with short-term gains but unchanged practices. Three interventions used social marketing and mixed media. Only one study took a multi-sectoral approach. Conclusions: At a macro level, opportunities to reduce or to end the practice of FGM/C exist through legislation, policy, a public health approach grounded in gender equality and human rights. Using multi-sectoral actions that consider the social context and challenge social norms at macro, meso and micro levels appears more effective than individual-level interventions. Promoting advocacy and developing supportive environments to reduce GBV, enhance gender equality and empower communities is crucial for interventions to succeed and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of FGM/C abandonment by 2030. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Arab diaspora; Arab League; female genital mutilation and cutting; FGM/C; interventions","advocacy; diaspora; female; public health; violence; adult; Arab; Biosis; Cinahl; education; Embase; female; female genital mutilation; gender based violence; gender equity; human; human experiment; human rights; law; male; Medline; PsycINFO; public health; quality control; review; Scopus; social environment; social marketing; social norm; sustainable development goal; systematic review; Web of Science; adverse event; Arab; migration; prevalence; Arabs; Circumcision, Female; Female; Human Migration; Humans; Prevalence",,,,,,"Shaeer, O., Shaeer, E., The Global Online Sexuality Survey: public perception of female genital cutting among internet users in the Middle East (2013) J Sex Med, 10 (12), pp. 2904-2911; Female genital mutilation 2020, , https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/female-genital-mutilation, Available from; Berg, R.C., Denison, E., Does female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) affect women's sexual functioning?

Using the TWAIL framework, the article illustrates TWAILers’ positions on the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) are an ideologist project that aims to transplant IP norms to developing countries and the role of actors, particularly industrialist lobbying in the making of international IP norms. Despite such views, the compromise that was made in the form of TRIPS’ flexibilities being threatened by ISDS mechanisms. Thus, the second objective of this article is to demonstrate the implications that recent IP-related ISDS disputes could potentially undermine the balance achieved through TRIPS.

It examines both the conditions conducive to such responses and the range of policy instruments available to these states. Yet this emerging work lacks a robust, contextualized account for how states devise the strategy and the content of their responses. This article builds on the policy-learning literature to elucidate the process through which states construct their antiTAN approaches. It suggests that states' policy paradigms in the field of domestic security largely shape those responses, with different paradigms offering distinct priorities and instruments. The comparison of the divergent impact of the Guatemalan state's contrasting responses to two similar legal-political challenges, undertaken in the context of the same anticorruption TAN campaign, illustrates the argument. © The Author 2022.

The purpose of their meeting was to discuss issues regarding the Alteration of Sex Description and Sex Status Act 49 of 2003, statelessness and the closure of Refugee Reception Offices in metro areas. The organisations involved play a critical role in representations and understandings of ‘transgender’ and ‘refugees and asylum seekers’ in South Africa, respectively. The meeting offered, I suggest, the perfect platform for organisations who, in their day-to-day work, assist transgender people seeking asylum in South Africa to come together, using the transgender refugee as an intersectional subject, around which their separate presentations might have easily coalesced. Yet, curiously, this did not happen. Extending transgender geographies in the Global South and offering an opening towards a broader conversation regarding advocacy for transgender refugees, I argue that transgender refugees represent a zone of precarious politics for organisations in South Africa dealing with competing marginalities. Indeed, it is not simply that transgender refugees are transgender but transgender and migrants, a dual precarity. This alignment with the migrant body is perceived as threatening by transgender organisations to the already precarious nature of transgender visibility. At the same time, given the increased global precarity of transgender rights, the inverse is true for refugee organisations. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Intersectionality; queer migration; trans precarity; transgender migrants; transgender refugees",,,,,,,"Andrade, V.L., Refugee Status Determination and Local Integration of Asylum Seekers and Refugees on the Basis of Sexual Orientation in Brazil and Spain (2018) Genius-Rivista di studi giuridici sull orientamento sessuale e l’identità di genere, 5 (2), pp. 88-103; Asante, G., Where is Home?” Negotiating Comm(Unity) and Un/Belonging among Queer African Migrants on Facebook (2022) Queer and Trans African Mobilities: Migration, Asylum and Diaspora, pp. 135-153. , Camminga B., Marnell J., (eds), London: Bloomsbury Academic,. edited by; Avgeri, M., Trans*It: Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Asylum Claimants’ Narratives in Greece (2021) Sexualities, , 13634607211013278; Beam, M., (2020) On Precarity and Trans Politics, , https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/on-precarity-and-trans-politics, Society and Space, May 12; Beauchamp, T., Artful Concealment and Strategic Visibility: Article Transgender Bodies and US State Surveillance after 9/11 (2009) Surveillance & Society, 6 (4), pp. 356-366; Browne, K., Nash, C., Hines, S., Introduction: Towards Trans Geographies (2010) Gender, Place & Culture, 17 (5), pp. 573-577; Butler, J., (2004) Precarious Life: The Power of Mourning and Violence, , London: Verso; Butler, J., Performativity, Precarity and Sexual Politics (2009) AIBR, Revista de Antropologia Iberoamericana, 4 (3), pp. i-xiii; Calland, R., (2007) Anatomy of South Africa: Who Holds the Power?, , Cape Town: Struik Publishers; Camminga, B., Categories and Queues: The Structural Realities of Gender and the South African Asylum System (2017) TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly, 4 (1), pp. 61-77; Camminga, B., The Stigma of Western Words’: Asylum Law, Transgender Identity and Sexual Orientation in South Africa (2018) Global Discourse, 8 (3), pp. 452-469; Camminga, B., Gender Refugees” in South Africa–the “Common Sense” Paradox (2018) Africa Spectrum, 53 (1), pp. 89-112; Camminga, B., (2019) Transgender Refugees and the Imagined South Africa: Bodies over Borders and Borders over Bodies, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Camminga, B., Encamped within a Camp: Transgender Refugees and Kakuma Refugee Camp (Kenya) (2020) Invisibility in African Displacements, pp. 36-52. , Bjarnesen J., Turner S., (eds), London: Zed Books,. edited by; Camminga, B., One for One and All for One?

In this paper, we reflect on how the concept has travelled through both space and time. We trace the longer history and more complex geography of intersectional approaches rooted in grassroots women’s movements in the Global South, where radical claims were made against the dominance of white, middle-class women’s analysis of the situation of women in the world. These, together with the Black women’s movement in the US, paved the way for the emergence and coining of the term intersectionality. We then reflect on how the concept travelled in three domains of migration-related knowledge: academic research, international policy and advocacy politics. We find that, while some academic research is true to the original politics of intersectionality, there is also some research that has strayed much further away from the original aims of intersectionality, to the extent that we would question whether it can be called intersectional at all. In international policy, we find that the original radicalism of the term has been watered down in the translation of the term into policy targets and measurements. Finally, in advocacy politics we find the greatest continuity with the original aims of the term. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Advocacy politics; ethnicity; gender; intersectionality; migration; policy; race; South-South migration",,,,,,"UKRI; GCRF: ES/S007415/1","Abutbul-Selinger, G., Shas and the Resignification of the Intersection between Ethnicity and Religion (2017) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 43 (9), pp. 1617-1634; Anthias, F., Transnational Mobilities, Migration Research and Intersectionality: Towards a Translocational Frame (2012) Nordic Journal of Migration Research, 2 (2), pp. 102-110; Avci, G., McDonald, C., Chipping Away at the Fortress: Unions, Immigration and the Transnational Labor Market (2000) International Migration, 38 (2), pp. 191-213; Barrios de Chungara, D., (1978) Let Me Speak!, , New York: Monthly Review Press, with Moema Viezzer; Basok, T., The Intersections of the Economic and Cultural in U.S. Labor’s Pro-Migrant Politics (2008) Social Justice, 35 (4), pp. 12-32; Basok, T., Piper, N., Management versus Rights: Migration of Women and Global Governance Organizations in Latin American and the Caribbean (2012) Feminist Economics, 18 (2), pp. 35-61; Bastia, T., Migration as Protest: Negotiating Gender, Class and Ethnicity in Urban Bolivia (2011) Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 43 (7), pp. 1514-1529; Bastia, T., Intersectionality, Migration and Development (2014) Progress in Development Studies, 14 (3), pp. 237-248; Bastia, T., (2019) Gender, Migration and Social Transformation: Intersectionality in Bolivian Itinerant Migrations, , London: Routledge; Bastia, T., Piper, N., Prieto-Carrón, M., Geographies of Migration, Geographies of Justice?

While there is a growing body of literature on specific policy measures to address care work in different contexts, there is no global practical tool to track progress against key policy areas. This article introduces the Care Policy Scorecard, an evidence-based policy tool developed through extensive collaboration between several institutions, care policy advocates, policymakers, and researchers in the global South and North. The Scorecard helps care advocates to assess how care-related policies are adopted, budgeted for, and implemented by governments, and to what extent they can transform the social organisation of care. The paper also includes preliminary results from the application of this tool in Kenya, and shares learnings from the use of the findings for national-level care policy advocacy. © 2022 Oxfam KEDV.","advocacy; Care work; feminist economics; policy; scorecard",,,,,,"","(2019), http://www.agenda2030feminista.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Monitoring_instrument_SRR.pdf, Monitoring Sexual and Reproductive Rights Catalonia’s 2030 Agenda: An Instrument of Feminist Advocacy; Barnat, N., MacFeely, S., Peltola, A., Comparing global gender inequality indices: how well do they measure the economic dimension?

During the twentieth century, the lack of legal and political institutions led to the isolation and marginalisation of refugee non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Asia, preventing them from providing the necessary refugee protection. However, since the creation of the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN), the role of NGOs in refugee protection has expanded rapidly in Asia. This research focuses on responding to the following questions. What factor(s) contributed to the emergence of Asian refugee NGOs as prominent advocates in refugee protection? How did local NGOs overcome structural obstacles to participate in national, regional and global advocacy? I argue that the theories of cognitive liberation, contentious politics and increased autonomy can help to explain how the APRRN, as a transnational network organisation, empowered NGOs, specifically in the Global South, to become active advocates. The APRRN facilitates the integration of the information, experience and resources that have been developed in Asian civil society, thus supporting local NGOs to effectively mobilise and distribute resources to overcome the structural asymmetry of power relationships in the global governance of refugee protection. © 2022 Global South Ltd.","APRRN; Asian civil society; autonomy; cognitive liberation; contentious politics; Refugees","autonomy; civil society; nongovernmental organization; politics; power relations; refugee; Asia",,,,,"MOE; NRF: NRF-2018S1A3A2075117","(2011), Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network Annual Report, 2010; (2011), http://www.aprrn.info/1/pdf/Newsletter%20July%202011.pdf, Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network Updates, July 2011.

Despite calls for solidarity, even “feminist” spaces face challenges for linking the Global North and South to advance advocacy efforts, challenges that are magnified when dealing with the issue of conflict-related sexual violence (CRSV). We focus on the stories of women diaspora activists working on active conflicts in the Global South and the ways these activists sought to embed themselves discursively in the WPS framework. We adopt an insider-outsider perspective to study their participation and draw insights on genderrelated aspects of diaspora inclusion. We argue that the constraints on including local voices and perspectives in WPS advocacy is certainly contributing to some of the cracks in implementation. However, the construction of transnational solidarity by women for women’s security issues is improving the possibilities for meaningful participation. © 2022","Conflict; Diaspora; Gender; Sexual violence; Transnational advocacy",,,,,,,"Agathangelou, A., Ling, L.H.M., The House of IR: From Family Power Politics to the Poises of Worldism (2004) International Studies Review, 6 (1), pp. 21-49. , https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1521-9488.2004.00448.x; Al-Ali, N.S., The case studies: The Jewish diaspora and the Arab-Palestinian-Israeli conflict (2007) Gender, diasporas and post-Cold War conflict, in Diasporas in conflict: Peace-Makers or peace-wreckers?, pp. 39-62. , H.

It evaluates the usefulness of three climate governance models: market failure, socio-technological transition and public support. For each group, three modes of action are considered: influencing, decision-making and implementing. The public support model is found to best capture the wide range of actors and real-world, complex participation patterns of domestic climate governance. The socio-technological transitions and market failure models in their narrow focus on political and business actors ignore the influencing roles of other groups, such as climate advocacy organizations, anti-climate action groups, Indigenous people’s organizations and labor unions. However, they offer more insight on actor engagement in decision-making and implementation, roles mostly ignored by the public support model. Overall, more systematic comparative research is needed on a wider range of actors, on domestic climate governance in the global South, on differences across countries, sectors and policy domains and on interactions between actors. © 2022 The Author(s).

Instigating collective processes that enhance prospects for rural permanence is crucial. The research gap that we face in this article is the limitation of research in knowledge co-creation dynamics based on the Citizen-Labs framework in rural environments located in the Global South. This article presents the systematisation of a LabCampesino, a space aimed at collaborative creating innovations for territorial management and alternatives to development from the rural youth in the Colombian countryside, as a new theoretical and methodological framework to examine knowledge generation. By applying a case study approach, this article explores the axes of agroecology, co-creation, and community organisation from a transdisciplinary and participatory action research lens. For this, sessions on exploration, experimentation, and prototyping were created in the province of Sumapaz, which led to learning around technologies and knowledge dialogue practices for the protection and reconstruction of peasant territories. The results demonstrate that the young participants can build, document and disseminate innovations at the community level related to situated technologies, processes and reflections on local socio-ecological processes. Thus, rural laboratories make possible practical, experimental, and situated rural education as a communal innovation experience in the territory, hand in hand with agroecological dynamics and political and social organisation, becoming places of articulation and advocacy for territorial actors and interests that seek a transformation of rurality. © 2022 The Authors","Communal innovation; Depeasantization; Knowledge co-creation; Rural laboratory; Sumapaz",,,,,,"40147; UNAL","Argueta, V.A., El diálogo de saberes, una utopía realista (2012) Revista Integra Educativa, 5 (3), pp. 15-29. , http://www.scielo.org.bo/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1997-40432012000300002&lng=es&tlng=es; Basabab, N., Manifesto of Trans-Disciplinarity (2002), State University of New York Albany; Bordignon, F., Laboratorios de innovación ciudadana, espacios para el hacer digital crítico (2017) Virtualidad, Educación y Ciencia, 14 (8), pp. 165-181. , https://revistas.unc.edu.ar/index.php/vesc/article/view/17343; Brandsen, T., Evers, A., Cattacin, S., Zimmer, A., Brandsen, T., Evers, A., Cattacin, S., Zimmer, A., Social innovation: a sympathetic and critical interpretation (2016) Social Innovations in the Urban Context, , Springer Open New York; Bunders, J.F.G., Broerse, J.E.W., Keil, F., Pohl, C., Scholz, R.W., Zweekhorst, B.M., How can transdisciplinary research contribute to knowledge democracy?

However, there are further opportunities to analyze the relationship between civil society litigation and state institutions in Global South cities. In this paper, I analyze civil society litigation to re-open Refugee Reception Offices (RROs) in South Africa. Primarily based on legal research, I argue that civil society litigation to re-open RROs in specific cities represents an advocacy strategy to contextualize national rights and policies within urban spaces.

Popular criticisms of orphanages highlight the potential harm of institutionalised living, including abuse and exploitation associated with the global rise of voluntourism and the intensified disadvantages young people face when transitioning out of institutionalised care. Yet, these concerns often lack cultural specificity and understanding of complex lived experiences from the Global South, instead reinforcing a simplistic image of young people in care as passive or damaged victims. This article examines the narratives of young people who grew up in an orphanage in Thailand. Now in their early 20s, nine young Thais participated in interviews and a focus group which they saw as self-advocacy regarding their experiences of care as the orphanage shifted from a small residential house of 40 children to a larger institution with 100 children. Participants reported a loss of intimate care as the orphanage grew, damaging their sense of self and precipitating their using strategies to obtain desired forms of care, with implications for their adult relationships. Such insights are important for informing alternative care policies that nurture the sort of care that matters to those with lived experience. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Alternative care; narrative; orphans; theories of care; youth transitions",,,,,,,"Akintola, O., Hlengwa, W.M., Dageid, W., Perceived Stress and Burnout Among Volunteer Caregivers Working in AIDS Care in South Africa (2013) Journal of Advanced Nursing, 69 (12), pp. 2738-2749; Beazley, H., Bessell, S., Ennew, J., Waterson, R., The Right to be Properly Researched: Research with Children in a Messy, Real World (2009) Children’s Geographies, 7 (4), pp. 365-378; Bertrand, M., Johnson, S., Samphantharak, K., Schoar, A., (2008), https://www.nber.org/papers/w13738, Mixing Family With Business: A Study of Thai Business Groups and the Families Behind Them.

In particular, the underrepresentation of students with ID in representative roles in schools underscores the need to consider notions of in-school participation. Based on Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology perspective, this study investigates the lived experience of all stakeholders involved in the process of students with ID becoming representatives in a Brazilian school. Several collaborative preparatory meetings were held with key stakeholders. The six participants interviewed were the teacher of the resource room, two student representatives with ID, the pedagogical coordinators, and a mother of the student representative. The results showed that the students’ representation was an inclusive practice that allowed students to develop advocacy skills. This study contributes with a practical application on how a school can create opportunities for students to voice their collaboration in the Global South. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","disability representation; inclusive practices; intellectual disabilities; self-advocacy; student participation; students’ voices",,,,,,,"(2019) Action Research for Inclusive Education: Participation and Democracy in Teaching and Learning, , Armstrong F., Tsokova D., (eds), Abingdon, OX: Routledge, edited by; Andersson, E., The School as a Public Space for Democratic Experiences: Formal Student Participation and its Political Characteristics (2019) Education, Citizenship and Social Justice, 14 (2), pp. 149-164; Antunes, M.A.M., (2014) A psicologia no Brasil: leitura histórica sobre sua, , São Paulo: EDUC; Bhattacharya, K., (2017) Fundamentals of Qualitative Research: A Practical Guide, , New York, NY: Routledge/Taylor & Francis Group; Black, R., Student Participation and Disadvantage: Limitations in Policy and Practice (2011) Journal of Youth Studies, 14 (4), pp. 463-474; Bogdan, R., Biklen, S., (2007) Qualitative Research for Education: An Introduction to Theories and Methods, , 5th ed., Boston, MA: Pearson A&B; Booth, T., The Name of the Rose: Inclusive Values Into Action in Teacher Education (2011) Prospects: Quarterly Review of Comparative Education, 41 (3), pp. 303-318; (2015), Institui a Lei Brasileira de Inclusão da Pessoa com Deficiência (Estatuto da Pessoa com Deficiência; Briant, M.E.P., Oliver, F.C., Inclusão de crianças com deficiência na escola regular numa região do município de São Paulo: conhecendo estratégias e ações (2012) Revista Brasileira de Educação Especial, 18 (1), pp. 141-154; Canguilhem, G., (1991) The Normal and the Pathological, , New York: ZoneBooks; Clarke, V., Braun, V., Thematic Analysis (2017) The Journal of Positive Psychology, 12 (3), pp. 297-298; Cordeiro, M.P., (2011) Nada sobre nós sem nós: vida independente, militância e deficiência, , São Paulo: Annablume editora, FAPESP; Fielding, M., Whole School Meetings and the Development of Radical Democratic Community (2013) Studies in Philosophy and Education: An International Journal, 32 (2), pp. 123-140; Flick, U., (2009) An Introduction to Qualitative Research, , 4th ed, London: Sage Publications; Goodfellow, A., Looking Through the Learning Disability Lens: Inclusive Education and the Learning Disability Embodiment (2012) Children's Geographies, 10 (1), pp. 67-81; Holt, L., Geographies of Young Disabled People (2015) Identities and Subjectivities.

Despite these developments, few studies have investigated the global expansion of the baby food industry, nor the market and political practices corporations have used to grow and sustain their markets. In this paper, our aim is to understand the strategies used by the baby food industry to shape ‘first-foods systems’ across its diverse markets, and in doing so, drive milk formula consumption on a global scale. We used a theoretically guided synthesis review method, which integrated diverse qualitative and quantitative data sources. Results: Global milk formula sales grew from ~US$1.5 billion in 1978 to US$55.6 billion in 2019. This remarkable expansion has occurred along two main historical axes. First, the widening geographical reach of the baby food industry and its marketing practices, both globally and within countries, as corporations have pursued new growth opportunities, especially in the Global South. Second, the broadening of product ranges beyond infant formula, to include an array of follow-up, toddler and specialized formulas for a wider range of age groups and conditions, thereby widening the scope of mother-child populations subject to commodification. Sophisticated marketing techniques have been used to grow and sustain milk formula consumption, including marketing through health systems, mass-media and digital advertising, and novel product innovations backed by corporate science. To enable and sustain this marketing, the industry has engaged in diverse political practices to foster favourable policy, regulatory and knowledge environments. This has included lobbying international and national policy-makers, generating and deploying favourable science, leveraging global trade rules and adopting corporate policies to counter regulatory action by governments. Conclusion: The baby food industry uses integrated market and political strategies to shape first-foods systems in ways that drive and sustain milk formula market expansion, on a global scale. Such practices are a major impediment to global implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, and other policy actions to protect, promote and support breastfeeding. New modalities of public health action are needed to negate the political practices of the industry in particular, and ultimately to constrain corporate power over the mother-child breastfeeding dyad. © 2021, The Author(s).","Baby food industry; Breastfeeding; Breastmilk substitutes; Commercial determinants of health; Corporate power; Corporate science; Food systems; Infant formula; Lobbying; Milk formula","breastfeeding; food industry; food market; globalization; milk; policy implementation; political system; advertising; article; artificial milk; breast feeding; child; commodification; female; follow up; government; human; infant; lobbying; marketing; mass medium; public health; quantitative analysis; synthesis; toddler; breast feeding; breast milk; food industry; international cooperation; United States; Breast Feeding; Female; Food Industry; Humans; Infant; Infant Formula; Internationality; Milk, Human",,,,,"WHO","Hastings, G., Why corporate power is a public health priority (2012) Br Med J, 345. , https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.e5124; Moodie, R., Stuckler, D., Monteiro, C., Sheron, N., Neal, B., Thamarangsi, T., Profits and pandemics: prevention of harmful effects of tobacco, alcohol, and ultra-processed food and drink industries (2013) Lancet., 381 (9867), pp. 670-679; Freudenberg, N., (2021) At what cost: modern capitalism and the future of health, , Oxford University Press, USA; McKee, M., Stuckler, D., Revisiting the corporate and commercial determinants of health (2018) Am J Public Health., 108 (9), pp. 1167-1170; Smith, J.P., Markets, breastfeeding and trade in mothers’ milk (2015) Int Breastfeed J., 10 (1), pp. 1-7; Jelliffe, D.B., Jelliffe, E.P., (1978) Human milk in the modern world, , Oxford University Press, Oxford; Uvnäs Moberg, K., Ekström-Bergström, A., Buckley, S., Massarotti, C., Pajalic, Z., Luegmair, K., Maternal plasma levels of oxytocin during breastfeeding—a systematic review (2020) PLoS One., 15 (8), pp. 1-38; Victora, C.G., Bahl, R., Barros, A.J., França, G.V., Horton, S., Krasevec, J., Breastfeeding in the 21st century: epidemiology, mechanisms, and lifelong effect (2016) Lancet., 387 (10017), pp. 475-490; Walters, D.D., Phan, L.T., Mathisen, R., The cost of not breastfeeding: global results from a new tool (2019) Health Policy Plan., 34 (6), pp. 407-417; (2003) Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, , https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/infantfeeding/9241562218/en/, Geneva, Available from; (2020), https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/infant-and-young-child-feeding/#status, New York, Available from; Neves, P.A.R., Barros, A.J.D., Baker, P., Piwoz, E., Santos, T.M., Gatica-Dominquez, G., Consumption of breast milk, formula and other non-human milk by children aged under two years: Analysis of 86 low and middle-income countries (2020) Public Health Nutr, pp. 1-20. , https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020004061; Bergevin, Y., Dougherty, C., Kramer, M.S., Do infant formula samples shorten the duration of breast-feeding?

In spite of these commonalities, libraries are often overlooked as development partners. This is unfortunate because these partnerships could allow librarians to more fully and effectively participate in the development of their communities. This paper explores strategies that libraries might employ to make themselves more visible to development organizations. It does so through analysis of interviews with practitioners who have funded or implemented development projects across countries in Africa. We find that these practitioners are open to working more with libraries, but that it will take a lot of work on the part of public libraries to accomplish broad shifts in perception amongst development agencies. Collecting and openly sharing data on the output and impact of public libraries is a first step in this work, but these efforts must also be augmented through increased marketing and networking by libraries. Libraries need to build internal capacity to use data to drive advocacy efforts and attract funding from development donors. © 2021 Jason C.

As middle-class women have entered the workforce in large numbers, and state provision of childcare and other welfare services has been scaled back under neo-liberalism, there has been an unprecedented outsourcing of household labour to the market. The resulting commodification of social reproduction has not liberated women from the demands of housework but has largely shifted this work away from women in the Global North towards migrant women workers from poor and heavily indebted countries of the Global South. At the same time, there has also been a huge increase in internal migration within Global South countries, as newly wealthy middle classes in the cities are being serviced by poor rural women. Commodified domestic labour relies on the existence of gendered and racialised migrant workers. This article examines the domestic workers’ strike as an effective and urgent mode of political action given the massive and growing concentration of migrant women in domestic work. This requires a reassessment of earlier feminist strategies based on a nuclear family model and current advocacy strategies that, influenced by foundations, have rejected the strike tactic in favour of limited legal strategies. This article draws on my empirical research on domestic workers’ movements in the USA and India in order to highlight emerging strategies of labour movements. © 2021 The Author(s).","commodification; contentious labour organising; domestic work; migrant women; social reproduction; strikes",,,,,,,"Anderson, B., (2000) Doing the Dirty Work?

Over-dependency and over-reliance on Western security models culminate in the “one-size fits all” model of critical security studies produced by the West. However, in Africa, insecurity is growing. This paper argues that there is a need for security models that address African countries’ particular cultures, values, and realities, hence our advocacy of afro-democracy. This study introduces the concept of afro-democracy as a model that can facilitate security and development in Africa. It also argues that the field of critical security studies should welcome contributions from other parts of the world, namely the Global South. © The Author(s) 2021.","Africa; afro-democracy; European Union; Global South; Nigeria; security",,,,,,,"Aborisade, R.A., Accounts of unlawful use of force and misconduct of the Nigerian police in the enforcement of covid-19 measures (2021) Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s11896-021-09431-4, Advance online publication; Abrahamsen, R., Sando, A., (2018) The Global South and International Security, , https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198777854.013.24, April, The Oxford Handbook of International Security, (Eds; Adejumo-Ayibiowu, D., Western style ‘democracy’ in Africa is just a way of pushing the neoliberal agenda (2020) openDemocracy, , https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/western-style-democracy-in-africa-is-just-a-way-of-pushing-the-neoliberal-agenda/, July, 13, (Ed.).

This paper explores this phenomenon and its effects on educational programs designed to prevent gender-based violence in Brasilian schools. It argues that this gender backlash in educative spaces violates fundamental rights, like the right to equality and protection against discrimination and violence, and ultimately contributes to the continuity and escalation of gender-based violence in Brasil. This context shapes advocacy work and the facilitators and participants of its programs. Primary prevention research is mainly conducted in the Global North. This article, guided by a southern feminist framework and informed by 14 interviews with Brasilian advocates engaged in youth gender-based violence prevention programs, addresses a significant knowledge deficit and offers new insights in working in challenging contexts. It suggests that the backlash is mostly directed at LGBTIQA+ cohorts due to the ongoing political attacks on these groups, but it has also undermined the capacity of educational prevention strategies for gender-based violence more widely. © 2021 Queensland University of Technology.

Shit flow diagram (SFD) has emerged as the preferred tool for the planning and advocacy of FSM services. Besides context-specific challenges, FSM planning, especially the use of SFD is impeded by the lack of data related to on-site sanitation systems (OSSs) and lack of capacity at the local level. This paper sets out to demonstrate how the capacity-building approach can be extended to overcome these two challenges in planning FSM with a substantial share of the information collected through household surveys. We argue that even the resource-constrained towns in the Global South have access to college students, smartphones and open source applications and demonstrate how they can be harnessed to collect the data in a cost-effective manner. Using the data collected by 150+ university students, participants of a summer school, we prepare a SFD for Alleppey, a town in Kerala, India. We argue such repeated exercises by subsequent batches of students can help understand local problems, arrive at context specific solutions and monitor them to instill better accountability of local governments. We also identify two issues with the current SFD preparation process and find it is necessary to contextualise the output of the tool to use it for planning. We suggest that the methods demonstrated here be incorporated in the future refinements to the SFD tool to make it more useful for planning city-wide FSM services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection; Faecal sludge management; Household survey; On-site sanitation; Sanitation planning; SDG 6","drinking water; ground water; capacity building; detection method; household structure; household survey; planning process; student; urban agriculture; urban area; urban planning; Article; capacity building; city planning; college student; environmental sanitation; feces; government; household; human; information processing; Kerala; organic waste; pollution control; questionnaire; sewer; shit flow diagram; sludge management; solid waste management; university student; city; feces; India; sanitation; sewage; India; Varanidae; Cities; Feces; Humans; India; Sanitation; Sewage",,"Sewage",,,"IITB","Agarwal, R., Alappuzha Gets Recognised by UNEP for its Solid Waste Management Practices (2017), https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/waste/alappuzha-gets-recognized-by-unep-for-its-solid-waste-management-practices-59258#:~:text=TheCentreforScienceand,sustainablesolidwastemanagementpractices, Down To Earth [WWW Document] accessed 4.30.21; Ananth, M., Rajesh, R., Amjith, R., Achu, A.L., Valamparampil, M.J., Harikrishnan, M., Resmi, M.S., Nujum, Z.T., Contamination of household open wells in an urban area of trivandrum, Kerala state, India: a spatial analysis of health risk using geographic information system (2018) Environ.

This will enable an evaluation of extant research and provide insight into directions for future research. Study design: This study was a scoping review of academic literature. Methods: A scoping review of academic literature published between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2020 was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses framework. Boolean searches were conducted using a university library platform, which included databases, such as EBSCO host, Informit, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. Data were extracted using an a priori code frame, and publication, content, and disciplinary characteristics were analysed. The results of coding and screening comparison checks were within acceptable limits. Results: In total, 2672 works from around the world were identified and screened for inclusion. Twenty-two English language articles were included in the final analysis. The public health community's use of social media for policy advocacy purposes has largely been approached from a health perspective, despite research and scholarship about social media in communication and policy disciplines (among others). Reported research aims or questions emphasised functional rather than theoretical contributions. Most analysed works used empirical or case study–based methods and were produced by authors in Western geographies. Among the health issues discussed, tobacco and tobacco control were discussed most frequently. While recognising issues with social media, most publications framed social media as more of an opportunity than a problem. Conclusions: The public health community's use of social media for policy advocacy purposes is an emerging field. There is considerable potential to expand scholarship and research in this field internationally, especially by integrating transdisciplinary knowledge and perspectives and by applying social media to foster policy change around identified global health challenges. Greater representation of authors from institutions in the Global South is also encouraged, as are applied and theoretical contributions. © 2021 The Royal Society for Public Health","Advocacy; Advocacy-for-health; Health promotion; Public health policy; Scoping review; Social media","advocacy; communication network; comparative study; developing world; health policy; local participation; media role; meta-analysis; public health; smoking; social media; tobacco; English (language); geography; global health; health promotion; human; human experiment; meta analysis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; public health; review; ScienceDirect; Scopus; social media; systematic review; theoretical study; tobacco; health care delivery; policy; public health; Nicotiana tabacum; Scopus; Delivery of Health Care; Global Health; Humans; Policy; Public Health; Social Media",,,,,,"Reid, E.J., Understanding the word “advocacy”: context and use (2000) Structuring the inquiry into advocacy, pp. 1-8. , J.

In this context, this article explores the underlying forces determining the formation, endurance, and power of BRICS–South transnational advocacy networks (TANs) opposed to BRICS-based corporate extraction in the global South. By analyzing activism against Chinese, Indian, and Brazilian extractive projects in Ecuador, Ethiopia, and Mozambique, respectively, the research reveals the critical importance of domestic politics and civil society characteristics in both the BRICS and host states for shaping BRICS–South TANs, including which groups assume leadership, the extent of cross-national cooperation, and the role of nonprofits headquartered in the global North. The findings uncover core reasons for the variable resiliency and capacity of BRICS–South TANs, opening up new avenues of research and offering valuable insights for activists and policymakers. © The Author(s) 2021.","Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa; Ecuador; Ethiopia; extraction; Mozambique; transnational advocacy networks","advocacy; civil society; extraction; politics; Ecuador; Ethiopia; Mozambique",,,,,"SSHRC: 435-2014-0115","Aguiar, D., Pacheco, M.E., (2016) The South-South cooperation of the peoples of Brazil and Mozambique, , https://fase.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ProSavana-Ing.pdf, Federação de Órgãos para Assistência Social e Educacional; (2018) It’s time to end land grabs and establish food sovereignty in Gambela, , https://landmatrix.org/media/uploads/aso_report_may_2018-2.pdf; (2019) GRAIN, Kenya Peasants’ League, & South Indian Coordination Committee of Farmers’ Movements Karuturi Global’s new land deal in Ethiopia must be scrapped, , https://grain.org/en/article/6258-karuturi-global-s-new-land-deal-in-ethiopia-must-be-scrapped, GRAIN; Beri, R., India’s evolving blueprint for cooperation with Africa (2016) India’s approach to development cooperation, pp. 125-140. , Chaturvedi S., Mulakala A., (eds), Routledge, (Eds.), (., -; Bond, P., Garcia, A., BRICS from above, commoning from below (2020) The Routledge handbook of transformative global studies, pp. 165-180. , Hamed Hosseini S., Goodman J., Motta S.C., (eds), Routledge, (Eds.), (., -; Bratman, E.Z., Contradictions of green development: Human rights and environmental norms in light of belo monte dam activism (2014) Journal of Latin American Studies, 46 (2), pp. 261-289; Cabral, L., Leite, I., Pro SAVANA and the expanding scope of accountability in Brazil's development cooperation (2015) Global Policy, 6 (4), pp. 435-445; Carpenter, R.C., Governing the global agenda: “Gatekeepers” and “issue adoption” in transnational advocacy networks (2010) Who governs the globe?, pp. 202-237. , Finnemore M., Avant D., Sell S.K., (eds), Cambridge University Press, (Eds.), (., -; Cezne, E., Forging transnational ties from below: Challenging the Brazilian mining giant vale S.A. across the South Atlantic (2019) The Extractive Industries and Society, 6 (4), pp. 1174-1183; Chandran, R., Gardner, T., (2017) Calls to end Africa’s “horrific” land deals after Indian firm’s fallout, , https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-landrights-india-idUSKBN1DS1FK, Reuters; Chen, J., Transnational environmental movement: Impacts on the green civil society in China (2010) Journal of Contemporary China, 19 (65), pp. 503-523; Cheru, F., Emerging Southern powers and new forms of South-South cooperation: Ethiopia's strategic engagement with China and India (2016) Third World Quarterly, 37 (4), pp. 592-610; Christensen, D., Weinstein, J.M., Defunding dissent: Restrictions on aid to NGOs (2013) Journal of Democracy, 24 (2), pp. 77-91; Dagnino, E., Teixeira, A.C.C., The participation of civil society in Lula's government (2014) Journal of Politics in Latin America, 6 (3), pp. 39-66; Daniel, A., Neubert, D., Civil society and social movements: Conceptual insights and challenges in African contexts (2019) Critical African Studies, 11 (2), pp. 176-192; Dauvergne, P., Farias, D.B.L., The rise of Brazil as a global development power (2012) Third World Quarterly, 33 (5), pp. 903-917; den Hond, F., de Bakker, F., Boomerang politics: How transnational stakeholders impact multinational corporations in the context of globalization (2012) A stakeholder approach to corporate social responsibility: Pressures, conflicts, reconciliation, pp. 275-292. , Kolter P., Maon F., Lindgreen A., (eds), Gower, (Eds.), (., -; Denny, D.M.T., Recent business and human rights Brazilian regulation (2019) Beijing Law Review, 10 (4), pp. 643-655; Deva, S., (2016) Background paper for India’s National Framework on Business and Human Rights.

This article extends insights about women's exclusion from such Community Networks (CNs) by considering commoning', or practices that produce, reproduce and use the commons and create communality. I generated data in interviews and observations of rural CNs in seven countries in the Global South and in multi-sited ethnography of international advocacy for CNs. Male biases in technoculture and rural governance limit women's participation in CNs, and women adopt different approaches to performing their communal identity while using technology. This situation contributes to detaching CNs from relations that are produced in women's commoning. It also illustrates processes that co-opt the commons in rural technology endeavours and the diverse ways commoners express their subjectivities in response. © 2021 ACM.","commoning; Community networks; gender; global south; rural HCI","Human computer interaction; Community networks; Rural connectivity; Shared use; Small scale; Ubiquitous computing",,,,,"H2020: 780890","www.afchix.org/projects/; Aludhilu, H.N., Bidwell, N.J., Home is not Egumbo: Language, identity and web design (2018) Proceedings of the 2nd African Conference on Human Computer Interaction (AfriCHI'18).

It does so by drawing theoretical insights from John Kingdon's streams framework, historical institutionalism, and ideational perspectives to explicate how tobacco control rose to the status of government policy agenda. Methods: The main sources of data are government documents, media reports, archival studies, grey literature, and published books and articles. These sources were supplemented by key informant interviews with government officials, civil society groups, and other vested interest groups. Findings: This article finds that the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases in the late 1980s, the political commitment of Mauritius's Labour government to comprehensive tobacco control, the institutional legacies of Mauritius's Public Health Act of 1925, and the administrative capacity of Mauritius's Ministry of Health and Quality of Life are the primary factors that drove tobacco control policies in Mauritius. Conclusion: The findings from this study will enrich our understanding of policy change and the politics of tobacco control in the global south. Future research should investigate why some countries in Africa have failed to adopt comprehensive tobacco control policies despite ratifying the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. © 2021 Duke University Press.

They kindly agreed to perform this interview collectively, working together to bring to the fore the powerful text that follows. Ana is active in urban movements in Serbia, as well as within the European Action Coalition for the Right to Housing and the City (EAC). She is also one of the editors of the Radical Housing Journal and the Interface: A Journal for and about Social Movements. Ioana is a researcher at the University of Gothenburg focusing on urban policies, urban power structures and related inequalities, as well as a housing activist based in Bucharest, Romania. Veda is an activist and engaged theorist based in Bucharest too, where she has been involved in resisting evictions, organising occupations and building community around collective space. Veda currently works as the facilitator of the EAC. Both Ioana and Veda are involved as militant researchers and organisers with The Common Front for Housing Rights and with the national housing justice confederation BLOCK for Housing, active in several cities and villages in Romania. Last but not least, Zsuzsi is a member of Rakóczi Collective, a group working on establishing rental-based housing cooperatives in Hungary. She is also a founding member of Periféria Policy and Research Center, an independent, critically engaged organisation working on issues of spatial justice and housing based in Budapest. Her work revolves around political economy, with an emphasis on understanding macro-scale dependencies, with a thematic focus on housing.Michele Lancione and Colin McFarlane If you have to think at Eastern European cities from a “global’ point of view, what comes to mind? How can you position Eastern European cities within global urban geographies of exchanges, material and immaterial flows, and the likes? Ana Vilencia, Ioana Florea, Veda Popovic and Zsuzsi Pósfai The historical position of Eastern Europe within global material and immaterial flows has been a semi-peripheral one, depending on and serving the Western core, while continuously trying to maintain its position as a less exploited territory than the Global South and the further East (Arrighi, 1994). Eastern Europe was largely rural at the beginning of the twentieth century and is still recording around 45% rural population today. Thus, historically, it has represented an extraction site for raw materials and agricultural products and, in the last three decades, for cheap 307labour with “European quality” this is considered by national and international decision makers and lobbyists as its main competitive advantage today. The dependent relations towards the West came with a long series of disadvantageous commercial treaties (Ban, 2014), with accumulating cycles of extraction through financial relations (Raviv, 2008) and with a deepening debt relation both on the scale of the state and of individual households (Becker et al., 2015). With Western Europe struggling to tackle its own economic crises since the 1970s, the peripheries of Europe became an important “buffer zone” - mainly for investing surplus capital and for reducing costs of production by relocating certain production facilities to these countries. Thus we can broadly say that the West exported its economic crisis effects to the East - strong examples of which could be experienced in the years following the 2008 crisis (idem). In the meantime, generations of local elites have gazed towards the West with an aspirational ethos and with limited bargaining power when attempting to strengthen their (local/regional/global) positions. Since the nineteenth century, the dependency also came with a fast circulation of capital, technologies, political forms and discourses. This also deepened with the economic and political project of the European Union. Thus it is particularly interesting to understand dependent relations within Europe - which on a global scale is often seen as a “black box” of “advanced” economic development. In parallel, the semi-peripheral dependency came with discourses of European belonging (Popovici and Pop, 2016) marked by what decolonial scholars termed “nested orientalism” (Bakić-Hayden, 1995): in dominant discourses, Eastern Europe has never been “actually Europe” it always had to prove its Europeanness; it had to hide or reject its Oriental past as connected to the history of the Ottoman Empire or the Eastern Bloc; it had to prove its “return to Europe” after the 1945-1989 “deviation towards” or “kidnapping by” communist regimes (Florea, 2015). The main paradigm used in the last 30 years to describe the social/political phenomena in the region has been about “catching up” with the West, when in fact the uneven and dependent development of Southern and Eastern Europe has been a prerequisite for the economic advancement of core European countries (Becker et al., 2015). © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Michele Lancione and Colin McFarlane.",,,,,,,,"Arrighi, G., (1994) The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power, and the Origins of Our Times., , London and NewYork: Verso; Bakic-Hayden, M., Nesting Orientalisms: The case of former Yugoslavia (1995) Slavic Review, 54 (4), pp. 917-931; Ban, C., (2014) Dependents si dezvoltare.

However, contemporary sex education on HIV/AIDS—if taught to undergraduates before they arrive on campus—often does not account for the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on racial minorities and global South countries. In this teaching essay, the author describes how his course on the history of HIV/AIDS takes a global approach to highlight that the AIDS crisis is not over. Starting with histories of HIV/AIDS in the United States, Haiti, China, and elsewhere that sought to find a scapegoat for the pandemic, the course then turns to the global power of the pharmaceutical industry. It examines the marketing and lobbying strategies of companies such as Gilead, which use the stigma of HIV/AIDS to transform impoverished global South countries into new markets for research and capital extraction. Finally, it also highlights how the AIDS crisis remains an ongoing struggle against racial disparities in health care that prevent access to life-saving treatments and preventative drugs such as Truvada and Descovy for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Using a range of materials from podcasts to pills, the author introduces students to the globalizing forces that take the bodies of the poor, women, and Black, Latinx, trans, and global South citizens as expendable in the fight against HIV/AIDS. © 2021 by MARHO: The Radical Historians’ Organization, Inc.","global health; health care; HIV/AIDS; pharmaceuticals; PrEP",,,,,,,"ACT UP Oral History Project, , www.actuporalhistory.org/, AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power.

This concept helps consider how specific social, economic and political hierarchies and policies produce and pattern poor health in two case studies: one at the USA-Mexico border and another in Djibouti. Migrants' and providers' various entanglements within inequitable and sometimes violent global migration systems can produce shared structural vulnerabilities that then differentially affect health and other outcomes. In response, we argue providers require specialised training and support; professional associations, healthcare institutions, universities and humanitarian organisations should work to end the criminalisation of medical and humanitarian assistance to migrants; migrants should help lead efforts to reform medical and humanitarian interventions; and alternative care models in Global South to address the structural vulnerabilities inherent to migration and asylum should be supported. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

Such advocacy draws on best practice case examples, but these are frequently presented in decontextualised ways. Drawing from an account of densification processes and policies in six cities-Moscow, Curitiba, Sydney, Johannesburg, Delhi and Saõ Paulo-the paper shows that while policy is sometimes similar, outcomes are deeply embedded in national and local contexts and are therefore variable and complex. In the polarised debate between compaction and managed sprawl, the fact is often missed that both sprawl and densification are happening simultaneously in most cities. Analysis of the cases also suggests that insufficient attention has been paid within both the analytical and policy literature to the influence of property markets and associated politics, the role of informality, and how politics and institutions shape the outcomes of compaction policy, including the agency of local people. © 2021 Liverpool University Press.

Building on state-of-the-art and participatory research on farming, urbanism, food policy and advocacy in the field of food system transformation, this book changes the way food planning has been conceptualised to date and invites the reader to fully embrace the transformative potential of an agroecological perspective. Bringing in dialogue from both the rural and urban, the producer and consumer, this book challenges conventional approaches that see them as separate spheres, whose problems can only be solved by a reconnection. Instead, it argues for moving away from a 'food-in-the-city' approach towards an 'urbanism' perspective, in which the economic and spatial processes that currently drive urbanisation will be unpacked and dissected, and new strategies for changing those processes into more equal and just ones are put forward. Drawing on the nascent field of urban political agroecology, this text brings together: i) theoretical re-conceptualisations of urbanism in relation to food planning and the emergence of new agrarian questions, ii) critical analysis of experimental methodologies and performing arts for public dialogue, reflexivity and food sovereignty research, iii) experiences of resourceful land management, including urban land use and land tenure change, and iv) theoretical and practical exploration of post-capitalist economics that bring consumers and producers together to make the case for an agroecological urbanism. Aimed at advanced students and academics in agroecology, sustainable food planning, urban geography, urban planning and critical food studies, this book will also be of interest to professionals and activists working with food systems in both the Global North and the Global South. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Chiara Tornaghi and Michiel Dehaene; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,,,,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",,,,,,9780429782374; 9781138359673,,,"English","Resour. an Agroecol.

E. B. Du Bois, the editor of the Crisis, a journal of the ‘darker races’ that was the organ of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was among the earliest African American intellectuals to take a strong interest in Gandhi. However, the African American press, represented by newspapers such as the Pittsburgh Courier and the Chicago Defender, was as a whole prolific in its representation of the Indian Independence movement. This article, after a detailed consideration of Du Bois’s advocacy of Gandhi’s ideas, analyses the worldview of the African American press and its outlook towards the movement in India. It is argued that a more ecumenical conception of the ‘Global South’ ought to be sensitive to African American history, and I suggest that African American newspapers played a critical role in shaping notions of the solidarity of coloured peoples, pivoting their arguments around the Indian Independence movement and particularly the satyagraha campaigns of Gandhi. © 2021 Council for Social Development.","coloured peoples; Mohandas Gandhi; non-violence; The Crisis; transnational history; W.

This article hinges on a recent effort spear-headed by the Centre of Conservation Studies at University of San Carlos in Guatemala, to discuss how a counterhegemonic narrative offers fertile grounds for a decolonized reading of the metabolic rift. I use my notes from eight workshops held in 2018 as the empirical body for a discourse analysis where the emerging categories have been singled out and problematized in the light of ethnoecological theory and David Harvey’s moments for the transition towards a post-Capitalist society vis-à-vis a prevailing environmental regime characterized by its verticality, lack of scientific substantiation, and proclivity to privilege exchange value at the expense of widening the metabolic rift. This regime arguably spawns several ecological rifts, namely the following: (1) between conventional scientific parlance and traditional ecological knowledge; (2) between utility-inspired natural resource management and local land husbandry practices; and (3) between nature as a reservoir of resources and nature as the sustenance for life. In addition, I present a case study where local advocacy in a peripheral community managed to bring about a relevant shift in the correlation of political powers by seizing the national legislation to achieve a transfer of property rights that enabled the inception of a brand-new nature reserve. The new conservation paradigm in question, this case seems to suggest, dovetails adequately with civil society’s efforts to foster nature-conservation practices, in line with human well-being and sound environmental governance. The latter provides some evidence for a principle of hope – à la Ernst Bloch – whereby, dissident groups are paving the way for a grassroots-oriented conservation science that eventually could bridge the metabolic rift. © The Author(s) 2020.","decolonial nature conservation; Grassroots-based advocacy; metabolic rift",,,,,,,"Calderón, C., Jerónimo, C., Praun, A., Agroecology-based farming provides grounds for more resilient livelihoods among smallholders in Western Guatemala (2018) Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, 42 (10), pp. 1128-1169; Callon, M., Latour, B., ‘Tu ne calculeras pas’! ou comment symétriser le don et le capital (1997) Revue du MAUSS, 9 (1), pp. 45-70; Cassegard, C., Eco-Marxism and the critical theory of nature: Two perspectives on ecology and dialectics (2017) Distinktion, 18 (3), pp. 314-332; Castañeda Salguero, C., Interacción sociedad-naturaleza en la Guatemala prehispánica (2017) Eutopía, 2 (3), pp. 43-102; Caudillo Félix, G.A., El buen vivir: un diálogo intercultural (2012) Ra Ximhai, 8 (2), pp. 345-364; Collard, R.-C., Dempsey, J., Accumulation by difference-making: An anthropocene story, starring witches (2018) Gender, Place & Culture, 25 (9), pp. 1349-1364; Dougherty, M., The global gold mining industry, junior firms, and civil society resistance in Guatemala (2011) Bulletin of Latin American Research, 30 (4), pp. 403-418; Fairhead, J., Leach, M., Scoones, I., Green grabbing: A new appropriation of nature?

These processes have been driven by the market initiatives and lobbying of private financial actors, as well as by the actions of states in seeking to promote economic growth and the interests of the financial firms headquartered on their territories. The general trend has been for states to provide the increasingly globalized architecture for markets, for instance through trade and investment agreements, and then these markets are regulated and stabilized by public and private bodies, often operating globally. Over time, global finance seen has a growth in the importance of the European Union and the global south, including China. A persistent tension is the interest and capacity of the financial industry to innovate in ways that expand the industry but bring risks and crises that governments then need to manage. The chapter discusses the major approaches for analyzing business and public policy in finance, including the implications of the 2008 global financial crisis for these. © Aynsley Kellow, Tony Porter and Karsten Ronit 2021.",,,,,,,,"Arner, D.W., Barberis, J., Buckley, R.P., FinTech, RegTech, and the Reconceptualization of Financial Regulation (2017) International Law & Business, 37 (3), pp. 371-413; Atik, J., Repenser NAFTA Chapter 11: A Catalogue of Legitimacy Critiques (2003) Asper Review of International Business and Trade Law, 3, pp. 215-234; Backer, L.C., Private Actors and Public Governance Beyond the State: The Multinational Corporation, the Financial Stability Board, and the Global Governance Order (2011) Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies, 18 (2), pp. 751-802; Baker, A., (2006) The Group of Seven: Finance Ministries, Central Banks and Global Financial Governance, , London and New York: Routledge; Baker, A., Macroprudential Regimes and the Politics of Social Purpose (2018) Review of International Political Economy, 25 (3), pp. 293-316; (2017) High-Level Summary of Basel III Reforms, , https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424_hlsummary.pdf, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; (2020) Press release: Governors and Heads of Supervision announce deferral of Basel III Implementation to increase operational capacity of banks and supervisors to respond to Covid-19, , https://www.bis.org/press/p200327.htm; Barth, J.R., Caprio, G., Levine, R., (2008) Rethinking Bank Regulation: Till Angels Govern, , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Bauerle Danzman, S., The Political Economy of Bilateral Investment Treaties (2019) Research Handbook on Foreign Direct Investment, pp. 11-38. , Markus Krajewski and Rhea Tamara Hoffman (eds.), Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA, USA: Edward Elgar Publishing; Biggins, J., Scott, C., Public-Private Relations in a Transnational Private Regulatory Regime: ISDA, the State and OTC Derivatives Market Reform (2012) European Business Organization Law Review, 13 (3), pp. 309-346; Blake, D.J., Thinking Ahead: Government Time Horizons and the Legalization of International Investment Agreements (2013) International Organization, 67 (4), pp. 797-827; Botzem, S., (2012) The Politics of Accounting Regulation: Organizing Transnational Standard Setting in Financial Reporting, , Cheltenham, UK and Northampton, MA, USA: Edward Elgar Publishing; Broz, J.L., Congressional Politics of International Financial Rescues (2005) American Journal of Political Science, 49 (3), pp. 479-496; Butler, T., O’Brien, L., Understanding RegTech for Digital Regulatory Compliance (2019) Disrupting Finance, pp. 85-102. , Theo Lynn, John G.

Framed within an overarching emancipatory narrative of creating access for and empowering the margins through data exchanged on the global free market, hegemonic Open Science processes co-opt and erase Southern epistemologies, working to create and reproduce new enclosures of extraction that serve data colonialism-capitalism. In this essay, drawing on our ongoing negotiations of community-led culture-centered advocacy and activist strategies that resist the racist, gendered, and classed structures of neocolonial knowledge production in the metropole in the North, we attend to Southern practices of Openness that radically disrupt the whiteness of hegemonic Open Science. These decolonizing practices foreground data sovereignty, community ownership, and public ownership of knowledge resources as the bases of resistance to the colonial-capitalist interests of hegemonic Open Science. © The Author(s) 2021.","Culture-Centered Approach; Data Colonialism; Data Resistance; Data Sovereignty; Data Sovereignty; Decolonization; Global South; Open Science","advocacy; capitalism; decolonization; ownership; sovereignty",,,,,,"Adams, G., Dobles, I., Gomez, L.

This paper explores this phenomenon and its effects on educational programs designed to prevent gender-based violence in Brasilian schools. It argues that this gender backlash in educative spaces violates fundamental rights, like the right to equality and protection against discrimination and violence, and ultimately contributes to the continuity and escalation of gender-based violence in Brasil. This context shapes advocacy work and the facilitators and participants of its programs. Primary prevention research is mainly conducted in the Global North. This article, guided by a southern feminist framework and informed by 14 interviews with Brasilian advocates engaged in youth gender-based violence prevention programs, addresses a significant knowledge deficit and offers new insights in working in challenging contexts. It suggests that the backlash is mostly directed at LGBTIQA+ cohorts due to the ongoing political attacks on these groups, but it has also undermined the capacity of educational prevention strategies for gender-based violence more widely. © 2021 Common Ground Research Networks.

Using key debates and interventions on air pollution, it examines the trajectories of environmental politics in the Delhi region, one of the most polluted areas in the world. It highlights the administrative struggles, public advocacy, and entrepreneurial innovations that have built creative new links between science and urban citizenship. The book describes the atmosphere of collaboration that pervades these otherwise disparate spheres in contemporary Delhi. Key features: Presents an original case study on urban environmentalism from the Global South Cuts across science, policy, advocacy and innovation Includes behind-the-scenes discussions, tensions and experimentations in the Indian air pollution space Uses immersive ethnography to study a topical and relevant urban issue As South Asian and Global South cities confront fast-intensifying environmental risks, this study presents a dialogue between urban political ecology (UPE) and science and technology studies on Delhi’s air. The book explores how the governance of air is challenged by scales, jurisdictions, and institutional structures. It also shows how technical experts are bridging disciplinary silos as they engage in advocacy by translating science for public understanding. The book serves as a reminder of the enduring struggles over space, quality of life, and citizenship while pointing to the possibilities for different urban futures being negotiated by variegated agents. The book will interest scholars and researchers of science and technology studies, urban studies, urban geography, environmental studies, environmental politics, governance, public administration, and sociology, especially in the Global South context. It will also be useful to practitioners, policymakers, bureaucrats, government bodies, civil society organisations, and those working on air pollution advocacy. © 2021 Rohit Negi and Prerna Srigyan.",,,,,,,,"Auyero, J., Swiston, D., (2009) Flammable: Environmental Suffering in an Argentine Shantytown, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Baviskar, A., Between violence and desire: Space, power, and identity in the making of metropolitan Delhi (2003) International Social Science Journal, 55 (175), pp. 89-98; Fortun, K., From Bhopal to the informating of environmentalism: Risk communication in historical perspective (2004) Osiris, 19, pp. 283-296; Fortun, K., Pushback: Critical data designers and pollution politics (2016) Big Data and Society, 3 (2), pp. 1-14; Ghertner, D.A., (2015) Rule by Aesthetics: World-Class City Making in Delhi, , New Delhi: Oxford University Press; Ghosh, S., (2019) Indian Environmental Law: Key Concepts and Principles, , New Delhi: Orient BlackSwan; Guttikunda, S.K., Gurjar, B.R., Role of meteorology in seasonality of air pollution in megacity Delhi, India (2012) Environment Monitoring and Assessment, 184, pp. 3199-3211; Harris, G., Holding your breath in India (2015) New York Times, , www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/opinion/sunday/holding-your-breath-in-india.html, Available at Accessed 11 May 2019; Heynen, N., Kaika, M., Swyngedouw, E., (2006) In the Nature of Cities: Urban Political Ecology and the Politics of Urban Metabolism, , New York: Taylor & Francis; Irfan, U., How Delhi became the most polluted city on earth (2017) Vox, , www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/11/22/16666808/india-air-pollution-new-delhi, Available at Accessed 9 September 2019; Mazoomdaar, J., Delhi air pollution higher than Beijing report denied’ (2014) Bbc.Com, , www.bbc.com/news/world-asiaindia-25957405, Available at Accessed 27 August 2020; Meattle, K., Aggarwal, B., (2018) How to Grow Fresh Air: India’s Top Experts Teach You How to Beat Air Pollution, , New Delhi: Juggernaut; Morton, T., (2013) Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World, , Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press; Narain, S., Consequences of inequality for sustainability (2016) IDS Bulletin, 47 (2A), pp. 113-115; Negi, R., Urban air (2020) Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East, 40 (1), pp. 17-23; Pearson, N.O., President Obama, the worlds worst air just took 6 hours off your life’ (2015) Sydney Morning Herald, , www.smh.com.au/environment/president-obama-the-worlds-worst-air-just-took-6-hours-off-yourlife-20150128-12zl16.html, Available at Accessed 14 April 2020; Priya, R., (2017) Local Environmentalism in Peri-Urban Spaces in India: Emergent Ecological Democracy?, , Brighton: STEPS Centre; Rademacher, A., Sivaramakrishnan, K., Introduction: Ecologies of urbanism in India (2013) Ecologies of Urbanism in India: Metropolitan Civility and Sustainability, pp. 1-42. , Rademacher, A. and Sivsaramakrishnan, K.

In this sense, the table is a place of influence and power. Critical IR, particularly those focussing on women’s participation in peace negotiations, in security discourses, and advocacy campaigns emphasise women must have a seat at the table to contribute to meaningful change. In this piece, I reflect on my everyday experiences of (in)security in teaching and practising security. I argue that structural measures of inclusion and diversity in the discipline of critical IR and security studies depoliticise meaningful and truly transformative inclusion by focussing on indicators, deliverables, action plans, and outcomes. These make gender hyper-visible rendering race, class, linguistic and other markers invisible. In this sense, having a seat at the table means nothing, as individuals could still remain powerless in the absence of genuine commitment of others occupying key positions in that table. © 2021 York University.","exclusions; global south; Indigenous knowledge; marginalisations",,,,,,,"Ahmed, S., (2017) Living a Feminist Life, , Durham: Duke University Press; Dados, N., Connell, R., 'The global south (2012) Contexts', 55 (No 1), pp. 12-13; Hepburn, S., (2020) The Conversation, , https://theconversation.com/rio-tinto-just-blasted-away-an-ancient-aboriginal-site-heres-why-that-was-allowed-139466; Lugones, M., Spelman, E., Have We Got a Theory for You: Feminist Theory, Cultural Imperialism and the Demand for ‘The Woman’s Voice (1983) Women’s Studies International Forum, 6 (6), pp. 573-581; Sartori, A., Whiteness in Development: A Critical Content Analysis of Peace Corps Marketing (2018) Understanding and Dismantling Privilege, 8 (2), pp. 27-49; Teaiwa, K., On Decoloniality: A View from Oceania (2020) Postcolonial Studies, 23 (4), pp. 601-603",,,"UBM Exhibition Singapore PTE LTD",,,,,21624887,,,,"English","Crit.

It adopts a qualitative approach using content analysis based on reports issued by multilateral agencies, legislative and judicial documents, and interviews. While in Brazil, specialized courts receive great notoriety and resources, in Indonesia, courts are neglected in terms of financial and human resources, recruitment, supervision, and support. Different from Indonesia, the process of creating specialized courts was endogenous in Brazil, controlled and conducted by members of the judiciary in courts and lobbying other government branches. The internal movement around the policies to address corruption and the direct connection between judges and international organizations led to the executive’s support and legislation change in Congress. © 2021, Instituto de Estudos Sociais e Politicos (IESP), UERJ.

Against this backdrop, data localisation has become one of the most prominent and disputed policy measures for states seeking to regulate cross-border data flows. This article argues that data localisation can be understood as the product of a new type of resource securitisation, namely data securitisation. This process is shaped by a range of state-specific political and economic issues, and by the outcome of the pressure exerted by national and foreign interest groups. Specifically, the article examines the case of India, where a set of policy measures and initiatives introduced in 2018 began a set of strict data securitisation moves; however, their results were ambivalent. On the one hand, economically driven data localisation requirements have been softened by the stark lobby of foreign governments and transnational corporations, in tandem with local actors, illustrating the structural limits faced by Global South states’ sovereign digitalisation policies. On the other hand, a geopolitically driven data securitisation move against Chinese firms has been successful. The article concludes by outlining what lessons Global South actors can draw from this case. © 2021 Global South Ltd.","data localisation; data politics; data securitisation; data sovereignty; India","developing world; geopolitics; political economy; security; sovereignty; India",,,,,,"Aaronson, S.A., What Are We Talking about When We Talk about Digital Protectionism?

It shows how the neoliberal counter-revolution required the defeat or quiescence of that project. But the victory of capital overt anti-systemic forces in the Global South and North has resulted in economic stagnation, extremes of impoverishment, political repression and ecological collapse. The novels analysed in this study assert the crying need to keep open a utopian perspective on alternatives to this baleful state of affairs. The conclusion therefore ends by revisiting two of the most compelling theorists of postcolonial democratisation, Frantz Fanon and Amilcar Cabral, before suggesting that their thematic and formal advocacy of critique and deliberation makes these novels into forms of political theory in their own right. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,"Agbese, P.O., Kieh, G.K., State Renewal in Africa: The Lessons (2007) Reconstituting the State in Africa, pp. 279-294. , Ed.

This paper explores the role of social enterprise in urban sustainability transitions. Using the UP Bike Share (UPBS), a university-based bicycle-sharing social enterprise (in Metro Manila, Philippines) as a case study, this paper aims to bring a more explicit social entrepreneurship perspective towards sustainability transitions research as well as draw insights from social enterprise as a social innovation to challenge existing sociotechnical regimes. Existing operator models of bike-sharing systems in other countries are predominantly for-profit vendors, publicly-owned entities and non-profit organizations. Emerging from civil society, UP Bike Share, on the other hand, is a social enterprise that grew into a social movement with a well-defined advocacy, and became part of a bigger social movement of sustainability advocates. Where previous attempts to establish a bike-sharing program by the local government, international development institution and public transport agency in Metro Manila failed, the UP Bike Share represents the first bike-sharing system in the Philippines that was successfully piloted, implemented and sustained. We then expound on three mechanisms by which UP Bike Share can achieve such transformation, namely: market formation, insertion into the broader social movement, and replication of innovation in other localities, supporting wider sustainability goals. We end with agenda for future research. © 2020","Community-based social enterprise; Global South; Micro-mobility; Sharing economy; Sustainability transitions","Nonprofit organization; Profitability; Sustainable development; International development; Non profit organizations; Social enterprise; Social entrepreneurship; Social innovations; Socio-technical regimes; Sustainability transition; Urban sustainability; Bicycles; advocacy; civil society; cycle transport; entrepreneur; mobility; public transport; sustainability; urban transport; National Capital Region; Philippines",,,,,"PCIEERD","Akemu, O., Whiteman, G., Kennedy, S., Social enterprise emergence from social movement activism: the Fairphone case (2016) J.

We explored 2 key obstacles to improved human–wildlife coexistence: coexistence inequality (how the costs and benefits of coexisting with wildlife are unequally shared) and intolerance. The costs of coexisting with wildlife are often disproportionately borne by the so-called global south and rural communities, and the benefits often flow to the global north and urban dwellers. Attitudes and behaviors toward wildlife (tolerance versus intolerance) vary with social and cultural norms. We suggest more empathetic advocacy is needed that, for example, promotes conservation while appropriately considering those who bear the costs of conflict with wildlife. To achieve more equitable cost-sharing, we suggest limiting the costs incurred by those most affected or by sharing those costs more widely. For example, we advocate for the development of improved wildlife compensation schemes, increasing the scale of rewilding efforts, and preventing wildlife-derived revenue leaching out of the local communities bearing the costs of coexistence. © 2020 Society for Conservation Biology","compensación; compensation; conflicto humano – fauna; desigualdad; human–wildlife conflict; inequity; retorno a la vida silvestre; rewilding; tolerance; tolerancia","conservation status; nature-society relations; rural population; stakeholder; urban population; wild population; animal; attitude; environmental protection; human; socioeconomics; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Attitude; Conservation of Natural Resources; Humans; Socioeconomic Factors",,,,,,"Anderson, D., (2017) Riding to reduce conflicts, , https://www.nrdc.org/experts/zack-strong/riding-reduce-conflicts-daniel-anderson, Available from, (accessed November 2018); Barua, M., Bhagwat, S.A., Jadhav, S., The hidden dimensions of human-wildlife conflict: health impacts, opportunity and transaction costs (2013) Biological Conservation, 157, pp. 309-316; Baruch-Mordo, S., Wilson, K.R., Broderick, J., Breck, S.W., A tool box half full: how social science can help solve human–wildlife conflict (2009) Human Dimensions of Wildlife, 14, pp. 219-223; Bauer, H., Müller, L., Van Der Goes, D., Sillero-Zubiri, C., Financial compensation for damage to livestock by lions on community rangelands in Kenya (2017) Oryx, 51, pp. 106-114; Baynham-Herd, Z., Redpath, S., Bunnefeld, N., Molony, T., Keane, A., Conservation conflicts: behavioural threats, frames, and intervention recommendations (2018) Biological Conservation, 222, pp. 180-188; Behr, D.M., Ozgul, A., Cozzi, G., Combining human acceptance and habitat suitability in a unified socio-ecological suitability model: a case study of the wolf in Switzerland (2017) Journal of Applied Ecology, 54, pp. 1919-1929; Bhatia, S., Redpath, S.M., Suryawanshi, K., Mishra, C., The relationship between religion and attitudes toward large carnivores in Northern India?

Yet I argue that the ‘transit country’ is a contested space, a space where ‘temporariness’ may be produced purposefully in order to limit opportunities for protection. In this paper, I argue that Thailand produces itself as a transit country in order to manage and control refugee and asylum seeker populations. Through several discursive and material tactics, including security spectacles, legal maneuvering, and migrant destitution, Thailand maintains and exploits the status of a ‘transit country.’ The purposeful construction of a place where ‘no one will stay’ challenges depictions of migration as linear movements defined by sources and destinations, where transit spaces become only more distance to traverse. While the production of transit countries has always been political, the case of Thailand suggests that the politics involved need not center the migration deterrence efforts of traditional destination countries of the Global North, but have implications within states and regions of the Global South as well. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","asylum; migration; mobility; refugee; Thailand; Transit","advocacy; asylum seeker; border region; nongovernmental organization; refugee; Thailand",,,,,"","Adamson, F.B., Tsourapas, G., The Migration State in the Global South: Nationalizing, Developmental, and Neoliberal Models of Migration Management (2019) International Migration Review, , Oct., 019791831987905; Baldwin-Edwards, M., ‘Between a Rock & a Hard Place’: North Africa as a Region of Emigration, Immigration & Transit Migration (2006) Review of African Political Economy, 33 (108), pp. 311-324; Bélanger, D., Silvey, R., An Im/Mobility Turn: Power Geometries of Care and Migration (2019) Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, pp. 1-18; Bernazzoli, R.M., Flint, C., Embodying the Garrison State?

Created in the context of a global call for extractive industry accountability, as well as increasing scrutiny of Canadian mining activities for alleged human rights and environmental abuses, the ESTMA aims to deter corruption via financial reporting requirements for Canadian extractive firms operating in Canada and abroad. By mandating that firms publicly disclose payments to various levels of government, however, the ESTMA is constructed atop global corruption discourse that identifies host states in the Global South as the source of social pathologies that facilitate corruption, largely excluding a critical analysis of extractive firms in the Global North. Drawing on interviews, document analysis of material related to the ESTMA and case studies of extractive firm financial reporting, this paper argues that under the ESTMA's financial reporting processes, corporate risk management trumps meaningful social regulation. While the Act does mandate disclosures useful to the advocacy community, limited oversight, a lack of standardized reporting and excluded activities under the Act mean that the ESTMA offers limited leverage to substantively address the human and ecological cost of Canada's extractive industry. As has resulted from transparency policies more broadly, however, the ESTMA provides firms a means to counter broader critique and, in complying with audit culture, promotes investment security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Audit culture and risk; Canada; Global resource transparency; Legislation; Mining firms; North-South relations",,,,,,,"“Canada is Back” But Still Far Behind (2016), https://aboveground.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Canada-is-back-report-web.pdf, Available at; Amin, S., Maldevelopment: Anatomy of a Global Failure (1990); Arond, E., Bebbington, A., Dammert, J.L., NGOs as innovators in extractive industry governance.

My study of six cases in Africa, Asia and Latin America responds to this political project. Rural populations in LMICs often comprise more women, and increasingly, older women; rural governance and the technoculture of CNs, however, have masculine biases. Discussions, interviews and observations involving 152 women and 172 men champions, operators, users and non-users showed that women are less likely than men to use CN services and be paid for their labour in CNs. Women manage their personal aspirations, identities and expectations about their labour in various ways, and younger women seek alternatives to connect, sometimes setting up independent enterprises. Thus, maintaining the commons ethos that sustains CNs requires attending to different women's approaches. © 2020 ACM.","CN; Community Networks; Community WiFi; Exclusion; Feminist solidarity; Gender divide; Generation divide","Telecommunication industry; Community networks; Latin America; Low and middle income countries; Rural community; Rural population; Telecom company; Rural areas",,,,,"H2020: 780890; IDRC","Antoniadis, P., Local networks for local interactions: Four reasons why and a way forward (2016) First Monday, 21 (12); Antoniadis, P., The organic internet: Building communications networks from the grassroots (2018) CoDesigning Economies in Transition, pp. 235-272. , Vincenzo Mario Bruno Giorgino and Zack Walsh (eds.).

As the title says, we are talking about scholars from Latin America, as they were all born and raised in their home countries (even if some of them had educational forays abroad). But, we want to emphasize the notion that all five authors are in Latin America, as being in this region, and the Global South by extension, poses different challenges to making our voices heard (recognizing that there are incredible scholars from Latin America in the North who continue pushing the envelope and opening spaces for other scholars in the region to speak up and be published). This In Dialogue, then, is an opportunity to share with the RTE readership some of the ongoing challenges and successes that make the field of literacy studies in Latin America a very vibrant one, full of stories and voices that will emerge in this decade. This In Dialogue will highlight the visions and efforts of five global scholars, reframing literacy as we know it in their own terms. It is important to mention here that all five authors are invested in creating communities of learning, affinity, and advocacy, not just in developing their own agendas single-handedly. Community thinking has always been part of the Latin American ethos, and these examples that Raúl Alberto Mora and Claudia Cañas (Colombia), Patricia Rosas Chávez (México), and Cláudia Hilsdorf Rocha and Ruberval Franco Maciel (Brazil) will share in their essays are only a sample of this community.

Evangelicalism is one of the most rapidly expanding contemporary religious forms in the world. The engagement of South Sudan by evangelicals of the global north has been a major moment in its formation as a unique and critical international constituency. This work unsettles deeply rooted assumptions about these types of actors, their emergent politics and their locations in global governance relations. I argue that the politics of Sudan’s civil war represents a global moment in faith-based advocacy and humanitarianism, which is deeply implicated in a globalizing and globally-engaged evangelicalism. © 2019, © 2019 Department of Politics and International Studies.",,,,,,,,"Adamson, F.B., ‘Global liberalism versus political Islam: competing ideological frameworks in international politics’ (2005) International Studies Review, 7 (4), pp. 547-569; Agensky, J.C., ‘Dr Livingstone, i presume?

It is an elite field that is dominated by Western technical experts, many of whom have close ties to Western governments, and that is organized along vertical hierarchies. It works largely with states and militaries, and focuses a majority of its attention on military intervention into ongoing conflict as well as legal accountability after genocide has been committed. These priorities have had a dramatic impact on how genocide is defined and identified, preferencing the mass killing element of the crime and “reducing genocide to law,” as the legal scholar Payam Akhavan aptly put it in his 2012 book of that title. Although grassroots outreach is sometimes advocated, it is usually understood in terms of pressure politics and lobbying at the center of global power rather than as the empowerment of ordinary people worldwide as transformative and preventative agents in and of themselves. This article is both a call for critical self-examination of the field of genocide studies and a surfacing of paths not taken in the practice of genocide prevention. © 2022 Genocide Studies International.","civil society; critical genocide studies; genocide education; genocide prevention; grassroots organizing",,,,,,,"Thompson, Ginger, Listen to Children Who’ve Just Been Separated from Their Parents at the Border (2018) ProPublica, , 18 June; Bochenek, Michael Garcia, ICE Agents Use Deception, Coercion against Migrants (2018) Human Rights Watch, , https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/07/20/ice-agents-use-deception-coercion-againstmigrants#, 20 July; Lavandera, Ed, Morris, Jason, Simon, Darran, She Says Federal Officials Took Her Daughter While She Breastfed the Child in a Detention Center (2018) CNN.com, , 14 June; Fetters, Ashley, The Exceptional Cruelty of a No-Hugging Policy (2018) The Atlantic, , 20 June; Staff, Reuters, U.S. Centers Force Migrant Children to Take Drugs: Lawsuit (2018) Reuters, , 20 June; (2018) Neglect and Abuse of Unaccompanied Immigrant Children by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, , University of Chicago Law School International Human Rights Clinic & ACLU Border Litigation Project, (Chicago: U of Chicago Law School, May); Walker, Hunter, (2018) Businesses Have Made Millions Off Trump’s Child Separation Policy, , YahooNews. com, 19 June; Ainsley, Julia, Trump Admin Discussed Separating Moms, Kids to Deter Asylum-Seekers in Feb. 2017, , NBCNews.com, 18 June 2018; Akhavan, Payam, (2012) Reducing Genocide to Law: Definition, Meaning, and the Ultimate Crime, , (Cambridge: Cambridge UP); Hinton, Alex, Critical Genocide Studies (2012) Genocide Studies and Prevention, 7, p. 1. , https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/gsp/vol7/iss1/3, (accessed 4 Nov 2021); Winecoff, William Kindred, The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony,’ Revisited: Structural Power as a Complex Network Phenomenon (2020) European Journal of International Relations, 26 (1), pp. 209-252. , https://doi.org/10.1177/1354066120952876, (September): (accessed 12 Nov 2021); Hamburg, David, Democracy and Prevention of Mass Violence (2010) Preventing Genocide: Practical Steps toward Early Detection and Effective Action, pp. 117-139. , For a discussion of this, in (Boulder/London: Paradigm Publishers), –; and, Michael Mann, The Dark Side of Democracy (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2004); Moyn, Samuel, (2018) Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World, , (Cambridge, MA: The Belknap P of Harvard UP); Draper, Robert, (2020) To Start a War: How the Bush Administration Took America into Iraq, , (New York London: Penguin Press); Roth, Ken, (2004) War in Iraq: Not a Humanitarian Intervention, , https://www.hrw.org/news/2004/01/25/war-iraq-not-humanitarian-intervention, (New York: Human Rights Watch), (accessed 10 Nov 2021); Hirsch, Herb, Editor’s Introduction: MARO: Mass Atrocity Response Operations: A Military Planning Handbook: Selling the Mission and/or Protecting Human Rights?

UN-Habitat estimates that close to a billion people currently live in these deprived and informal urban settlements, generally grouped under the term of urban slums. Two major knowledge gaps undermine the efforts to monitor progress towards the corresponding sustainable development goal (i.e., SDG 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities). First, the data available for cities worldwide is patchy and insufficient to differentiate between the diversity of urban areas with respect to their access to essential services and their specific infrastructure needs. Second, existing approaches used to map deprived areas (i.e., aggregated household data, Earth observation (EO), and community-driven data collection) are mostly siloed, and, individually, they often lack transferability and scalability and fail to include the opinions of different interest groups. In particular, EO-based-deprived area mapping approaches are mostly top-down, with very little attention given to ground information and interaction with urban communities and stakeholders. Existing top-down methods should be complemented with bottom-up approaches to produce routinely updated, accurate, and timely deprived area maps. In this review, we first assess the strengths and limitations of existing deprived area mapping methods. We then propose an Integrated Deprived Area Mapping System (IDeAMapS) framework that leverages the strengths of EO-and community-based approaches. The proposed framework offers a way forward to map deprived areas globally, routinely, and with maximum accuracy to support SDG 11 monitoring and the needs of different interest groups. © 2020 by the authors.

Without dismissing occurrences of exploitation and malpractice, this chapter debunks some of the misconceptions surrounding adolescents’ labour migration. Drawing on qualitative studies in West Africa, the chapter provides evidence of how articulations of kinship and relatedness create opportunities to migrate and find work for rural adolescents, while also curbing their space to make independent decisions. Ideas about age and gender appropriate work and needs for protection underpin the constraints that boys and girls experience, respectively. However, the empirical material reveals that the permanence and depth of constraints depend on the socio-political constitution of the local labour market and on adolescents’ ability to navigate trans-local social relations. Through migration they negotiate a range of mobilities and transitions that contribute in different ways to social becoming. The chapter offers detailed insights into the ways in which intersecting mobilities shape adolescents’ lives to support their incorporation into a broader range of development initiatives, which are not premised on their rescue but on their roles as social and economic actors. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Tanja Bastia and Ronald Skeldon; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,"Abdul-Korah, G.B., ‘Where is not home?'

By citing jurisprudence from other jurisdictions in their pleadings, these legal advocates can convince courts that a trend is emerging and thereby create a global body of persuasive authority that can be used elsewhere in future cases. In this way, the dialogue among domestic courts and international tribunals is a form of norm diffusion. On certain constitutional matters with robust sharing among legal systems, such as abolition of the death penalty or decriminalization of homosexualityanti-sodomy laws, transnational legal citations can be a powerful tool of law reform. Although thetransnational judicial dialogue transnational judicial dialogue traditionally favored courts in the Global North, increasingly litigators have an incentive to cite cases from the Global South. This South-South dialogue is especially apparent in Commonwealth jurisprudence because of existing links. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Comparative constitutional law; Judicial dialogue; Legal citations; Norm diffusion; Strategic litigation",,,,,,,"Abebe, D., Does international human rights law in African courts make any difference?

It discusses the ways in which cancer-focused access-tomedicines activists have advocated for intellectual policy reform to enable the universal provision of cheaper biosimilar versions of trastuzumab, a highly effective treatment. Its central argument is that this cancer-focused access-to-medicines activism must be contextualised in relation to the history of AIDS advocacy on intellectual property and access to essential drugs. Firstly, as with the AIDS activism of the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) for access to anti-retroviral drugs in the late 1990s and early 2000s, contemporary cancer-focused activism has been led by individual patients affected by the excessive prices of essential medicines. Secondly, both can be characterised as having been effectively integrated into transnational access-to-medicines advocacy networks. Thirdly, both types of activism have involved the popularisation of the science around different drugs. The transnational access-to-medicines movement has demonstrated how activists based in the global North and the global South can impactfully collaborate to achieve wider treatment access. We can, therefore, read contemporary transnational access-tomedicines activism as key in pressing for both the right to enjoy the benefits of science and global health justice. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AIDS activism; biotechnology; Cancer activism; intellectual property",,,,,,"120420; CANSA; ","Right to Science Exemplars: Right to Benefit from Science, , https://www.aaas.org/resources/article-15/exemplars-right-benefit-science, Accessed 13March 2019; Roche (2016) ACT UP, , https://www.pharmagreedkills.com/roche, Accessed 28November 2018; Ali, F., Rajagopal, S., Biologics, Patents and Drug Prices (2018) The Hindu, , https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/biologics-patents-and-drug-prices/article22682251.ece, February, 7, Accessed 4March 2019; Andrews, L., Paradise, J., Genetic Sequence Patents: Historical Justification and Current Impacts (2009) Living Properties: Making Knowledge and Controlling Ownership in the History of Biology, pp. 137-163. , Gaudiliere J.P., Kevles D.J., Rheinberger H.-J., (eds), Berlin: Max Plank Institute for the History of Science, and,. edited by; Ataguba, J.E., McIntyre, D., Paying for and Receiving Benefits from Health Services in South Africa: Is the Health System Equitable (2012) Health Policy and Planning, 27 (1), pp. i35-i45; Blackwell, K., Gligorov, J., Jacobs, I., Twelves, C., The Global Need for Trastuzumab Biosimilar for Patients with HER2-Positive Breast Cancer (2018) Clinical Breast Cancer, 18 (2), pp. 95-113; Bray, F., Ferlay, J., Soerjomataram, I., Siegel, R., Torre, L., Jemal, A., Global Cancer Statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN Estimates of Incidence and Mortality Worldwide for 36 Cancers in 185 Countries (2018) CA: A Cancer Journal for Physicians, 68 (6), pp. 394-424; Calvert, J., Joly, P.-B., The Ontology of the Gene and the Patenting of DNA: How Did the Gene Become a Chemical Compound?

Grassroots women of the global South face the extreme impacts of climate change resulting in reinforced and exacerbated inequalities driven by a patriarchal capitalist economy. APWLD’s Climate Justice-FPAR 2017–2019 (CJ-FPAR) supported young women researchers across Asia to lead grassroots research to expose the disproportionate impacts of climate change on women to demand climate justice. The programme evaluation found that CJ-FPAR proved highly successful as a feminist political tool in enhancing grassroots women’s activism through capacity building, producing new knowledge, tools and resources, undertaking impactful advocacy, and strengthening the movements’ architecture. We argue that FPAR is a useful methodology for grassroots feminist climate justice activists to collectively document lived experiences of climate change and strengthen women’s movements to engage in strategic activism and advocacy for rights-based policy change. © 2020 Oxfam GB.","Asia; climate justice; feminist activism; Feminist Participatory Action Research; social movements; women’s human rights",,,,,,,"(2015), http://apwld.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/CJ-FPAR-regionalreport.pdf, Women Warming Up!

These 'Western-centric' assessments fail to consider the Global South's role in advancing their own human rights preferences. This article describes the Global South's norm advocacy at the Council from 2006 through 2017 using thematic resolutions, an understudied but preferred tool of the Global South at the Council. This article divides thematic resolutions into three possible motivations for Global South advocacy - in response to domestic issues, international issues, and cultural differences between regions, and includes an exemplary case study from each category. The article shows the Global South is very active in human rights promotion but chooses to focus on human rights that differ from the Global North. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2019","Climate change; Diplomacy; Family; Global South; Human rights; Norms; Racism; United Nations Human Rights Council (UN HRC)","advocacy; climate change; diplomatic relations; human rights; racism; spatial resolution; United Nations",,,,,,"Alston, P., The best interests principle: Towards a reconciliation of culture and human rights (1994) International Journal of Law, Policy and the Family, 8 (1), pp. 1-25; Annan, K., United Nations Needs New Human Rights Body: Transcript of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan Address before the 61st Session of the UN Human Rights Commission, pp. 74-75. , www.unpo.org/article/2287, accessed 21 March 2018; Freedman, R., (2014) Failing to Protect: The UN and the Politicisation of Human Rights, , Hurst & Company, London; Freedman, R., (2013) The UN Human Rights Council: A Critique and Early Assessment, , Routledge, London; Hug, S., Lukács, R., Preferences or blocs?

The article disentangles the abstract notion of advocacy capacity into concrete components, with eight core advocacy capacities identified: the capacity to (1) produce evidence, (2) inspire trust among power holders, (3) represent constituency interests, (4) analyse the political arena, (5) produce tailored messages, (6) work collectively, (7) build rapport with power holders, and (8) adapt to ongoing changes in the environment. Finally, the article reflects on the promises and pitfalls of using the capacity framework in real-world settings. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Aid–Capacity development, Aid effectiveness; Civil society–NGOs; Rights","developing world; international organization; marginalization; power relations; regional development; regional economy",,,,,,"Antlöv, H., Brinkerhoff, D.W., Rapp, E., Civil Society Capacity Building for Democratic Reform: Experience and Lessons from Indonesia (2010) VOLUNTAS: International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations, 21 (3), pp. 417-439; Barnes, C., Van Laerhoven, F., Driessen, P.P., Advocating for Change?

I argue that the use of human rights norms and strategies characterizes the “Global South route” to climate litigation, one that is firmly rooted in the trajectory of human rights adjudication and litigation in key Southern countries over the last three decades. I posit that, in order to understand the present and the future of this route, it is essential to (1) track its origins and features to the trajectory of “Global South constitutionalism” over the last three decades, especially litigation around socioeconomic rights, and (2) unpack the category of “Global South” countries, in order to avoid overgeneralizations and to identify the types of countries that are likely to see most climate litigation and court decisions. I close by suggesting that, in light of the planetary and urgent nature of the climate challenge, future research and advocacy should explore transnational forms of litigation that cut across the North-South divide and pay systematic attention to the impact of climate litigation. © César Rodríguez-Garavito 2020.

In this paper, we seek to contribute towards bridging this gap by identifying local practices connected to climate adaptation in six large Brazilian cities, and presenting a framework, based on the existing literature, for assessing constraints to adaptation across the municipal level. Although local governments are not the only actors who can take the lead through their actions, the employed framework considers that effective adaptation planning in urban areas is highly dependent on municipal efforts. Our findings indicate that six aspects have the highest levels of impact on adaptation in the Brazilian cities studied: administrative practices, political will, level of commitment, mismatch between the scale of urban issues and the extent of local government authority, pressures from private sectors, and inspection. Although these barriers are not specific only to climate issues and can be identified in other environmental arenas, when combined, they cause and worsen constraints to advancing urban adaptation at the local level. Specifically concerning the local dynamics of urban planning, the combination of pressures from private sectors and insufficient inspection negatively affects the ability of these cities to consolidate adaptation interventions. Our results are helpful in the context of large cities, particularly in Global South, where, as in Brazil, competitive urbanism and specific interest groups confront municipal efforts, and make achieving adaptation more difficult. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Brazil; Cities; Climate change; Local governments",,,,,,"CNPq: 446032/2015-8","Anguelovski, I., Carmin, J.A., Something borrowed, everything new: innovation and institutionalization in urban climate governance (2011) Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 3 (3), pp. 169-175; Anguelovski, I., Equity impacts of urban land use planning for climate adaptation: critical perspectives from the Global North and South (2016) J Plan Educ Res, 36 (3), pp. 333-348; Araos, M., Climate change adaptation planning in large cities: a systematic global assessment (2016) Environ Sci Pol, 66 (2016), pp. 375-382; Araos, M., Ford, J., Berrang-Ford, L., Biesbroek, R., Moser, S., Climate change adaptation planning for Global South megacities: the case of Dhaka (2016) Journal of Environmental Policy & Planning, 19 (6), pp. 682-696; Aylett, A., (2014) Progress and challenges in the urban governance of climate change: results of a global survey, , MIT, Cambridge; Aylett, A., Institutionalizing the urban governance of climate change adaptation: results of an international survey (2015) Urban Clim, 14, pp. 4-16; Biesbroek, G., On the nature of barriers to climate change adaptation (2013) Reg Environ Chang, 13, pp. 1119-1129; Jordan, A., Huitema, D., van Asselt, H., Forster, J., (2018) Governing Climate Change, , (eds; Broto, V.C., Urban governance and the politics of climate change (2017) World Dev, 93 (1-15), p. 2017; Brown, K., Westaway, E., Agency, capacity, and resilience to environmental change: lessons from human development, well-being, and disasters (2011) Annu Rev Environ Resour, 36, pp. 321-342; Bulkeley, H., Cities and the governing of climate change (2010) Annu Rev Environ Resour, 35, pp. 229-253; Bulkeley, H., Broto, V., Government by experiment?

Driven by the conviction that the Alt-Right is using the issues of migration and integration effectively to batter the defenses of liberal democracy, Professor Tom Farer argues that despite its strength, the moral case for open borders should be rejected and that while broadly tolerant of different life styles, the state should enforce core liberal values. Examining closely the policies and practices of various European states, Farer draws on their experience, contrasts it with that of the United States, and provides a detailed strategy for addressing the issues of who should be allowed to enter, how migrant families should be integrated and cultural conflicts resolved. This remarkable elaboration of a liberal position on migration and integration to which moderate conservatives could adhere combines powerful analysis with passionate advocacy. © Tom Farer 2020.",,,,,,,,"Adler, C., (1907) The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, , New York: Funk & Wagnalls; Akkerman, T., Hagelund, A., Women and Children First!'

Design/methodology/approach: The paper was developed by academics and practitioners in the field of ID in SA. A review of the literature, accompanied by a joint writing and discussion process was carried out to identify critical issues in the development of ID services, specifically facing the challenge of moving from racially based provision towards equitable services for all citizens with ID. Findings: Progressive policy has replaced practices of scientific racism which were previously used to support the establishment of white supremacism. This positive move is still in process and has not resulted in the immediate establishment of human rights. A vibrant civil society is engaging with this task currently. Research limitations/implications: The findings point to the need for a human rights approach that takes into account the postcolonial context of SA. Practical implications: There is a need for continued advocacy that is inclusive of people with ID and their families. Social implications: Continuing engagement between government and civil society is recommended to ensure the achievement of human rights for citizens with ID. Originality/value: This paper is of value to ID researchers and practitioners from the global South as it describes a non-western context that might have resonance with other low and middle income countries. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Education; Health; Human rights; Intellectual disability; Racism; South Africa",,,,,,,"Adnams, C.M., Perspectives of intellectual disability in South Africa: epidemiology, policy, services for children and adults (2010) Current Opinion in Psychiatry, 23, pp. 436-440; Burck, D.J., (1989) Kuoma Rupandi=(The Parts are Dry): Ideas and Practices Concerning Disability and Rehabilitation in a Shona Ward, , Afrika Studiecentrum, Leiden; Capri, C., Watermeyer, B., McKenzie, J., Coetzee, O., Intellectual disability in the Esidimeni tragedy: Silent deaths (2018) South African Medical Journal, 108 (3), pp. 153-154; Capri, C., Abrahams, L., McKenzie, J., Coetzee, O., Mkabile, S., Saptouw, M., Hooper, A., Swartz, L., Intellectual disability rights and inclusive citizenship in South Africa: what can a scoping review tell us?

It reports on a survey into prison health provision in Sierra Leone, West Africa conducted by a local non-governmental organization (Prison Watch – Sierra Leone). Taking the survey results as the point of departure and engaging with the limited literature on prison health provision in the South we discuss the role of health professionals in preventing violence in prisons, suggesting that, under compromised circumstances where a punitive penal ethos often subverts good intentions and appeals to professionalism, advocacy for prisoner health and torture prevention initiatives must be broad-based and include a more radical questioning of the foundations of the penal apparatus. Such circumstances call for a more critical interrogation of dominant forms of penality and generic modes of intervention than has hitherto been the case. © The Author(s) 2018.","Compromised circumstances;

While critics have challenged some aspects of the yield gap methodology, and the relevance of food security advocacy based on yield gaps, very few studies question the actual relevance, application and scalability of yield gaps for smallholder farmers (and researchers) in the tropics. We assess these limitations using two contrasting case studies: Maize-based farming systems in Western Kenya and rice-based farming systems in Central Luzon, the Philippines. From these two cases, we propose improvements in the use of yield gaps that would acknowledge both the riskiness of crop improvement options and the role that yield increases might play within local livelihoods. Participatory research conducted in Western Kenya calls into question the actual use and up-scaling of yield measurements from on-station agronomic trials to derive estimates of actual and water-limited yields in the region. Looking at maize yield gaps as cumulative probabilities demonstrates the challenges of assessing the real magnitude of yield gaps in farmers' fields and of deciding whose yield gaps count for agricultural development in Kenya. In the case of rice-based farming systems, we use a historical dataset (1966-2012) to assess changes in rice yields, labour productivity, gross margin and rice self-sufficiency in Central Luzon, the Philippines. While large rice yield gaps persist here, there appear to be few incentives to close that gap once we consider the position of crop production within local livelihoods. In this context, economic returns to labour for farm work were marginal: Labour productivity increased over time in both wet and dry seasons, but gross margins decreased in the wet season while no trend was observed for the dry season. since most households were rice self-sufficient and further increases in crop production would offer minimal returns while relying increasingly on hired labour, we question who should close which yield gap. Our case studies show the importance of contextualising yield gaps within the broader livelihood context in which farmers operate. We propose that this should be done at farm and/or farming systems level while considering the risks associated with narrowing yield gaps and looking into multiple performance indicators. © Cambridge University Press 2018.",,,,,,,,"Allan, A.Y., (1971) The Influence of Agronomic Factors on Maize Yields InWestern Kenya with Special Reference to Time of Planting, , Ph.D. thesis, Nairobi: University of East Africa; Angulo, C., Becker, M., Wassmann, R., Yield gap analysis and assessment of climate-induced yield trends of irrigated rice in selected provinces of the Philippines (2012) Journal of Agriculture and Rural Development in the Tropics and Subtropics, 113, pp. 61-68; Barker, R., Levine, G., (2012) Water Productivity in Context: The Experiences of Taiwan and the Philippines over the Past Half-century, p. 33. , Colombo, Sri Lanka: International Water Management Institute.

However, despite advocates acknowledging this shortcoming, the sector continues to grow. Moreover, over the past decade it has expanded its geographic scope, targeting poor communities in the Global North under the banner of financial inclusion. This article investigates the growth of the Australian sector. Analyzing the impacts of reforms to Australia's social security system alongside the political economy of the microfinance industry, it argues the debtfare state in Australia has provided fertile ground for microfinance's expansion. Documenting the advocacy strategies and tools to target vulnerable communities used by microfinance organizations and corporate partners, it charts how government support and subsidies have created a favourable regulatory environment, driving the sector's growth. This has benefitted these coalitions while displacing other forms of social security, despite the lack of robust evidence demonstrating microfinance's benefits for the poor. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Australia; banking; Debtfare; microfinance; social security",,,,,,,"Ahlin, C., Lin, J., Maio, M., Where does microfinance flourish?

Yet although there has been considerable academic inquiry into these messages, research focusing on the editorial processes that produce them is still limited. Moreover, the few studies that exist tend to focus on the finished products as seen at the INGOs' Western headquarters. This is particularly curious, given that most of these stories originate from the INGOs' fields of operation in the Global South and are initially collected, written and edited by communication staff in national offices. This paper explores the various editorial power centres in the INGO story production process from the perspectives of global South staff. Based on data collected from five INGOs operating in East Africa, the paper draws three key conclusions; that INGO editorial processes are dynamic, contested and heterogeneous, field office staff possess underappreciated agency in the story editing process, and the extent to which INGOs can be said to speak on behalf of those they claim to help is in part linked to the amount of agency that communication staffers in the global South possess. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; Development communications; ethnography; international development; International NGOs; non-participant observation; representation",,,,,,,"Achebe, C., An Image of Africa (1977) The Massachusetts Review, 18, pp. 782-794; (2017), http://www.actionaid.org/sites/files/actionaid/aai_ar_2016_final_low_res.pdf, Annual Report 2016.

Participating actors came together in an informal network that, by the late 1980s, expanded advocacy to include the promotion and reorganization of all forms of research that might improve health in the Global South. This goal became associated with a search for new research methods for determining priorities, a quest that reached a peak in the early 1990s when the World Bank entered the picture. The bank brought money, economic analyses, and neoliberal ideology to the research advocacy movement and helped stimulate an upsurge of cost-effective forms of economic thinking in global health (GH) circles. This expanded research network provided some of the conceptual foundations and leadership for several of the most emblematic institutions of the new GH. These included new organizations to bring together and coordinate public and private actors in pursuit of common aims and new forms of economic rationality. The network’s advocacy work contributed as well to a massive expansion of GH research at the turn of the century. © 2019, Johns Hopkins University Press.

This study's findings stress that both local and international organizations often focus on short-term program needs, while motives that relate to organizational goals, such as networking, improved reputation, or advocacy, are less prevailing.

Though largely forgotten today, the NIIO constituted a key platform of the 'Third World' solidarity movement. Latin America was a prominent site for NIIO activism, and this article examines the regional and local meetings that frequently brought together governing officials, reporters, and academics. Focusing on the shifting expectations of exiled Latin Americans living in Mexico City, the article explores the domestic political factors that eventually attenuated enthusiasm for the NIIO. By the late 1970s, Latin American advocates argued that repressive governments could not be trusted to safeguard socially responsible information initiatives, such as regional wire services. Moreover, they underscored that national democratization was necessary before global inequities could be resolved. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","Latin American democratization; Latin American media; New International Information Order; South-South exchange; Third Worldism",,,,,,"UCSD","The Term Later Evolved to Be the New World Information and Communication Order' (NWICO),which Is Now the More Commonly Used of the Two Phrases, , However, I employ the 'New International Information Order' to reflect the language utilized by advocates in the 1970s; Brendebach, J., (2017) The End of the New Order: Global Policies on Media and Means of Communication at UNESCO 1960s to 1980s, , PhD thesis, European University Institute; Philip, S., Golub, From the New International Economic Order to the G20: How the ""global South"" is restructuring world capitalism from within (2013) Third World Quarterly, 34 (6), pp. 1000-1015; Ogle, V., State rights against private capital: The ""new International Economic Order"" and the struggle over aid, trade, and foreign investment, 1962-1981 (2014) Humanity, 5 (2), p. 219. , Summer; William, G., Harley, (1993) Creative Compromise: The MacBride Commission, p. 98. , Lanham, MD: University Press of America; Hartenian, L., (2003) Controlling Information in US Occupied Germany 1945-1949: Media Manipulation and Propaganda, , New York: Edwin Mellen Press; Iber, P., (2015) Neither Peace Nor Freedom: The Cultural Cold War in Latin America, , Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Stephen, D., Krasner, (1985) Structural Conflict: The Third World Against Global Liberalism, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Gilman, New International Economic Order, p. 11; Rantanen, T., Foreign dependence and domestic monopoly: The European news cartel and US Associated Presses, 1861-1932 (2006) Media History, 12 (1), p. 26; Tworek, H., Magic connections: German news agencies and global news networks, 1905-1945 (2014) Enterprise and Society, 15 (4), pp. 673-675; Fenby, J., (1986) The International News Service: A Twentieth-century Fund Report, p. 7. , New York: Schocken Books; Byrne, Mecca of Revolution, 97, pp. 100-101; Guerra, L., (2012) Visions of Power in Cuba: Revolution, Redemption, and Resistance 1959-1971, p. 113. , Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press; Cullather, N., (1999) Secret History: The CIA's Classified Account of Its Operations in Guatemala 1952-1954, 75, pp. 82-83. , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; (1962) Office of the Secretary of Defense, Memorandum: Review of Operation Mongoose, , http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/620725%20Review%20of%20Op.%20Mongoose.pdf, 25 July (consulted 26 March 2017); Keller, R., Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency and the Cold War contest over information Journal of Cold War Studies, 19. , forthcoming; Barlow, W., Rebel airways: Radio and revolution in Latin America (1990) Howard Journal of Communications, 2 (2), pp. 126-127. , Spring; Byrne, Mecca of Revolution, pp. 146-151; Trejo Delarbre, R., (1989) Las Agencias de Información en México, , Mexico City: Editorial Trillas; Keller, R., (2015) Mexico's Cold War: Cuba, the United States, and the Legacy of the Mexican Revolution, p. 176. , New York: Cambridge University Press; Javier Solana, L., Mexico City Mexico (henceforth APLJS), Coordinación General de Comunicación Social (1981) Bases Estratégicas para la Construcción de un Sistema Nacional de Comunicación Social, 11, pp. 2100-2104; Diáz Rangel, E., (1976) Pueblos Subinformados, p. 68. , Caracas: Monte Avila Editores; Rangel, D., Pueblos Subinformados, p. 68; Delgado-Flores, C., Eleazar Diáz Rangel: Entre realidad y percepción política.

The Dalit protest movement, which advocates for the rights and protection of India's 230 million outcastes, has gained momentum largely due to its combined use of digital media and literary journalism. The work of Dalit feminist author Meena Kandasamy illustrates how literary perspectives are integral to and coextensive with the advocacy journalism of digital news platforms and social media in online protest movements. In protest poetry, song, and memoir the personal bleeds into the political, as it does in activist journalism, fueling the social movement. Kandasamy's literary journalism articulates Dalit literature's anticaste political aesthetic, particularly through her strategic use of digital media. India's activist digital media are currently propelled by the nation's literary culture and its creative and imaginative modes of expression, bearing important implications for digital literary journalism studies. © 2019 Literary Journalism Studies.

This paper draws lessons and implications on scaling social norms change initiatives for gender equality to prevent violence against women and girls (VAWG) and improve sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), from the Community for Understanding Scale Up (CUSP). CUSP is a group of nine organisations working across four regions with robust experience in developing evidence-based social norms change methodologies and supporting their scale-up across various regions and contexts. More specifically, the paper elicits learning from methodologies and experiences from five CUSP members–GREAT, IMAGE, SASA!, Stepping Stones, and Tostan. The discussion raises political questions around the current donor landscape including those positioned to assume leadership to take such methodologies to scale, and the current evaluation paradigm to measure social norms change at scale. CUSP makes the following recommendations for donors and implementers to scale social norms initiatives effectively and ethically: invest in longer-term programming, ensure fidelity to values of the original programmes, fund women’s rights organisations, prioritise accountability to their communities and demands, critically examine the government and marketplace’s role in scale, and rethink evaluation approaches to produce evidence that guides scale-up processes and fully represents the voices of activists and communities from the Global South. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Including perspectives from multiple world regions, the book takes account of institutions in the Global South, alongside better-known structures of the Global North. International contributors from a range of disciplines cover all the major aspects of research into NGOs in International Relations to present: a comprehensive overview of the historical evolution of NGOs, the range of structural forms and international networks coverage of major theoretical perspectives illustrations of how NGOs are influential in every prominent issue-area of contemporary International Relations evaluation of the significant regional variations among NGOs and how regional contexts influence the nature and impact of NGOs analysis of the ways NGOs address authoritarianism, terrorism, and challenges to democracy, and how NGOs handle concerns surrounding their own legitimacy and accountability. Exploring contrasting theories, regional dimensions, and a wide range of contemporary challenges facing NGOs, this Handbook will be essential reading for students, scholars, and practitioners alike. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Thomas Davies.

This opening led to a rapid influx of international investment, exposure to the international corporate social responsibility (CSR) community and presumed pressures to conform to related norms and practices. We report on a large-scale survey of firms operating in Myanmar, comparing perceptions of corporate practitioners of CSR and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our findings show that awareness levels of CSR among domestic Myanmar firms match those of their international peers, but the application of and selection criteria for CSR implementation by domestic firms in Myanmar differs from typical CSR activities observed in other parts of the world, in particular by Global North firms. More surprisingly, Myanmar firms have a higher awareness of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) than their multinational counterparts. Our findings have implications for CSR advocacy in Myanmar as well as for the dissemination of corporate responsibility and sustainability into the developing world more generally. © 2019 by the authors.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Sustainability; Global South; Institutional Theory; Myanmar; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals","advocacy; business; comparative study; corporate social responsibility; developing world; firm ownership; institutional reform; international trade; investment; perception; sustainable development; United Nations; Myanmar",,,,,,"Jamali, D., Karam, C., Corporate social responsibility in developing countries as an emerging field of study (2018) Int.

So far, global ethics has met the first standard much better than the second. Authors based in the global South contribute approximately 5% of the internationally published research on global ethics. With this in mind, the co-editors of this special issue sought to bring more perspectives, experiences, and authors from India into the international global ethics conversation, and so they launched the Indian Global Ethics Initiative. Their first step, this special issue, presents Indian experience and authors on topics including urban development, care ethics, women’s empowerment, fair trade, distorted policy research, poverty, and health. Much of this work is grounded by the authors’ experience in policy-making and advocacy for social and global justice.

The author in this chapter studies the generative environment of the UDHR, with the particular geopolitical and cultural dissonances of the post world war world, and follows through to its immediate aftermath. It especially looks at the literary advocacy of human rights that had come up in this period, where the right to write without persecution began to stand for a larger body of diverse rights. Traversing a wide range of literary engagement with human rights in the Global South and North - in testimonio, autobiography, political fiction, radical drama, community theater, war poetry, magical realism, and diasporic literature - the author shows how Cold War literature documents both the ideals and the failures of human rights as thought and action. © Cambridge University Press 2019.","Cold war; Political fiction; Theater; Universal declaration of human rights; Witness literature",,,,,,,"Universal Declaration of Human Rights, , www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html; Woodiwiss, A., (2005) Human Rights, p. 89. , London and New York: Routledge; Lightbody, B., (1999) The Cold War, p. 107. , London and New York: Routledge; Glendon, M.A., (2001) A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, p. 214. , New York: Random House; De Feyter, K., (2005) Human Rights: Social Justice in the Age of the Market, p. 19. , London and New York: Zed Books; Douzinas, C., (2007) Human Rights and Empire: The Political Philosophy of Cosmopolitanism, p. 24. , Abingdon and New York: Routledge-Cavendish; Shaffer, K., Smith, S., (2004) Human Rights and Narrated Lives: The Ethics of Recognition, p. 163. , New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Bystrom, K., Literature and Human Rights (2012) Handbook of Human Rights, pp. 637-646. , edited by Thomas Cushman (London and New York: Routledge; Dawes, J., (2007) That the World May Know: Bearing Witness to Atrocity, p. 6. , Cambridge, MA and London: Harvard University Press; Miłosz, C., Child of Europe (1988) T he Collected Poems 1931-1987, p. 86. , in Czesław Miłosz, London: Penguin; Soyinka, W., Foreword (1993) Universal Declaration of Human Rights: English, French, Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba, , Ibadan: Institut français de recherche en Afrique; Achebe, C., (1966) A Man of the People, , London: Heinemann; Hau’ofa, E., (1983) Tales of the Tikongs, , Auckland: Longman Paul; Slaughter, J.R., (2007) Human Rights, Inc.: The World Novel, Narrative Form, and International Law, p. 25. , New York: Fordham University Press; Mutua, M., (2002) Human Rights: A Political and Cultural Critique, p. 11. , Philadelphia:University of Pennsylvania Press; Gottlieb, E., (2001) Dystopian Fiction East and West: Universe of Terror and Trial, p. 17. , Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen’s University Press; Rosenberg, F.J., (2016) After Human Rights: Literature, Visual Arts, and Film in Latin America, 1990-2010, p. 5. , Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press; Farah, N., (1979) Sweet and Sour Milk, , London: Allison & Busby; Frame, J., (1970) Intensive Care, , New York: George Braziller; Soyinka, W., (1963) A Dance of the Forests, , London: Oxford University Press; Brenton, H., (1986) The Churchill Play, in Plays: One, p. 156. , London and New York:Methuen; Mitchell, T., (1987) File on Brenton, p. 90. , London and New York: Methuen; Tanner, T., (1971) City of Words: American Fiction 1950-1970, p. 15. , London: Jonathan Cape; Rich, A., An Atlas of the Diffi cult World (1991) An Atlas of the Diffi cult World: Poems 1988-1991, p. 4. , New York and London: W.W.

The language of the human right to water now underpins SDG6 which aims to progressively universalise equitable access to affordable water by 2030, with participation that reflects local realities. There has been a gradual depoliticisation of the global campaign to realise the human right to water as it has come to underpin global development initiatives. The practical and strategic innovation required to implement the right to water in complex underserved urban areas in the global South is lagging. This chapter considers how efforts to realise the human right to water in Bolivia could be progressively implemented in cities that have urbanised informally and have numerous informal providers. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Farhana Sultana and Alex Loftus; individual chapters, the contributors.

The purpose is to examine what meanings are given to ""internationalisation"" and ""the international"" over time, whom and how it would affect, as well as how the FHS would engage with the issues. The study uncovers a retrospective understanding of ""the international"" through former nationalistic discourses as well as new postcolonial and anti-imperialist criticism. It also shows how the responsibility for development issues individualises over time. In parallel, the FHS start to work with advocacy addressing Swedish society and make the transition from seeing themselves as educators of the Global South, to expecting to become educated by the Global South. The study depict how developmental issues as an educational area continues shape the institutional identity of the FHS over time. It problematises the role of the FHS in both mobilising solidarity engagement and at the same time establishing development issues as an important area of education for the middle classes of the Global North in a society under advanced liberalism. © Sofia Österborg Wiklund.","Education [utbildning]; Folk high schools [folkhögskolor]; Global development [global utveckling]; Internationalisation [internationalisering]",,,,,,,"Tidskrift för Svenska Folkhögskolan 1970-1989 (temanummer); (1972) Folkhögskolan Och Det Internationella, p. 4; (1974) Internationell Medvetenhet, p. 1; (1974) Folkhögskolan Och Det Internationella Engagemanget 1976:8 Internationalisering Inom Folkbildningsarbetet, p. 4; (1978) Resande Och Odlande Folkhögskolor, p. 7; (1980) Internationellt Ansvar Och Arbete, p. 8; (1984) Workshop -83 i Tanzania Och Exemplet Färneboskolan, p. 3; (1987) Tanzania, p. 1; (1987) Fred, p. 3; (1987) Like A Drop of Water, p. 8; (1988) Internationell Solidaritet, p. 7; Altbach Philip, G., Knight, J., The internationalization of higher education: Motivations and realities (2007) Journal of Studies in International Education, 11 (3-4), pp. 290-305; Aman, R., (2014) Impossible Interculturality?: Education and the Colonial Difference in A Multicultural World, 1, , ed., PhD diss.

Central lessons for other countries are that Costa Rica reversed its pathway of deforestation by reforesting the land and then addressing criticisms of its development by generating more genuinely green growth. Vietnam has previously focused on post-conflict restoration and economic development and has now turned towards green transformations, announcing an ambitious green growth strategy. The chapter shows that these countries – rather than having chosen easy pathways – made difficult choices that went against powerful vested interest groups within the country. This makes the decisions (and possibly the experiences) particularly relevant to other (smaller) countries considering taking a pathway involving green transformation. © Roger Fouquet 2019.

This chapter argues that the CRPD contains a “civil society mandate” founded upon Western assumptions of how disabled persons organisations (DPOs) should act and the disability consciousness and political advocacy that persons with disabilities should hold. The CRPD is the organising principle of the macro-level context that all persons with disabilities exist in. Through its article on civil society, the CRPD has globalised the expectation that both disabled individuals and their DPOs will be oriented towards rights advocacy. Developing DPOs and a disability consciousness according to the Western experience is therefore a central mission of the global disability movement that is promoting the CRPD. Several comparative studies of disability that take local context seriously point to another major difference in context - dire poverty. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Katie Ellis, Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, Mike Kent and Rachel Robertson; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,"Anspach, R.R., From stigma to identity politics: Political activism among the physically disabled and former mental patients (1979) Social Science & Medicine.

As such, ending violence against women is embedded in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of achieving gender equality and empowerment. This article gives voice to the intersection of race/ethnicity, class, geography, and gender in describing systemic and institutional power used to subjugate and isolate women experiencing domestic violence via examples from an Afro-Cuban woman and two Guatemalan indigenous women’s experiences with domestic violence. The United Nations has adopted resolutions that offer direction to social work in eliminating domestic violence. Social workers in the Global North must understand neoliberal policy and its impact on globalization processes in the Global South as they work to demand an end to intimate partner violence. Advocacy on behalf of domestic violence survivors then should be based on a human rights framework with postcolonial intersectional feminist theory to contextualize the experiences of women of color in Cuba and Guatemala. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Afro-descendent; Cuba; Domestic violence against women; Guatemala; Indigenous; Postcolonial intersectionality",,,,,,,"(2009), https://www.economist.com/node/14793737, A globe redrawn: after the Soviet collapse, The Economist.

While a robust body of literature has developed in critique of such theories and models, they continue to be applied in the Global South without much thought for their relevance to various non-Western cultural contexts. The current study explores the fit of these identity development theories to the experiences of 15 non-heterosexual and transgender individuals in Sri Lanka, gathered through a qualitative study of the question in 2016. These participants articulated gender and sexual self-conceptions that were incongruent with major identity development theories in significant ways. A broad majority failed to endorse central or salient sexual identities, while demonstrating a fluidity in object choice, sex roles, and sex acts, thus rupturing the theoretical notion of stable and coherent identities. Transgender participants did not demonstrate identity synthesis or pride and complicated theoretical understandings of sexual intimacy. These findings highlight the necessity of considering individual differences and cultural contexts when studying gender and sexuality and the dangers of universalizing theories across cultural differences. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cultural difference; Gender; LGBT identity development theories; Sexuality; Sri Lanka; Transgender","adult; article; conception; female; human; intimacy; male; qualitative research; sex role; sexuality; Sri Lanka; synthesis; theoretical study; transgender",,,,,,"Altman, D., Global gaze/global gays (1997) GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies, 3 (4), pp. 417-436; Asthanaa, S., Oostvogels, R., The social construction of male ‘homosexuality’ in India: Implications for HIV transmission and prevention (2001) Social Science and Medicine, 52, pp. 707-721; Berg, L., Millbank, J., Constructing the personal narratives of lesbian, gay and bisexual asylum claimants (2009) Journal of Refugee Studies, 22 (2), pp. 195-223; Bilodeau, B.L., Renn, K.A., Analysis of LGBT identity development models and implications for practice (2005) New Directions for Student Services, 111, pp. 25-39; Bockting, W., Knudson, G., Goldberg, J., Counseling and mental health care for transgender adults and loved ones (2006) International Journal of Transgenderism, 9 (3-4), pp. 35-82; Bogdan, R., Biklen, S., (2007) Qualitative research for education: An introduction to theories and methods, , 5, Pearson, New York; Boyce, P., Moral ambivalence and irregular practices: Contextualizing male-to-male sexualities in Calcutta/India (2006) Feminist Review, 83, pp. 79-98; Boyce, P., ‘Conceiving Kothis’: Men who have sex with men in India and the cultural subject of HIV prevention (2007) Medical Anthropology: Cross-Cultural Studies in Health and Illness, 26 (2), pp. 175-203; Braun, V., Clarke, V., Using thematic analysis in psychology (2006) Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3 (2), pp. 77-101; Butler, J., (1990) Gender trouble: Feminism and the subversion of identity, , Routledge, New York; Butler, J., (1997) The psychic life of power: Theories in subjection, , Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA; Cass, V., Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model (1979) Journal of Homosexuality, 4, pp. 219-235; Cass, V., Sexual orientation identity formation: A Western phenomenon (1996) Journal of Homosexuality, 9 (2-3), pp. 27-251; Coleman, E., Developmental stages of the coming-out process (1982) Homosexuality: Social, psychological and biological issues, pp. 49-158. , Paul W, Weinrich J, Gonsiorek J, Hotvedt M, (eds), Sage, Beverly Hills, CA; Currier, A., Migraine-George, T., Queer studies/African studies: An (im)possible transaction?

Such ethnocentric bias has frequently affected transnational feminist activism and commentary, as well as Northern governments’ immigration and international relations policies. To counteract this problem of ethnocentric bias, feminist scholars have proposed various methods by which to ethically undertake transnational feminist practice. Subaltern feminist activists have also undertaken particular measures to respond to the marginalization, sensitivities, and social pressures they face. In this essay, I argue that in order to ethically engage in transnational feminist research and activism, the Northern activist should adhere to five principles: namely, distancing oneself from problematic values and from feminism used as a cover for ulterior motives, discovering common viewpoints and then building upon these, engaging in advocacy that is fully absent of coercion, counteracting discourses that could further stigmatize underprivileged communities, and operating in a spirit of acceptance that both oneself and the other may be transformed through the process of transnational dialogue, a dialogue that is itself a matter in which no one party is completely right or wrong. © 2017 by The University of Chicago.

While there are legitimate theological disagreements, there has been a separation between ""Global South"" and ""Global North"" members of the denominations, as can be seen in the examples of United Methodism, Anglicanism, and Lutheranism. Schisms such as those based on human sexuality cannot overlook colonialism as a factor. Addressing this, Receptive Ecumenism has potential as a potent postcolonial method because Receptive Ecumenism offers tools that allow there to be dialogue among Christians who are particularly divided within denominations along lines created by colonialism, largely because of its posture of learning and listening. Indeed, if churches were to receive the methods of Receptive Ecumenism, by adopting a stance of active listening and learning, rather than a stance of self-advocacy and argument, the churches may find ways to heal internal divisions. © 2018 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","Anglican; decolonialism; Episcopalianism; Lutheran; Makane Yesus; postcolonialism; Receptive Ecumenism; United Methodist",,,,,,,"Robert, J.C., (2001) Young Postcolonialism: An Historical Introduction, pp. 15-17. , Oxford Blackwell esp. 25, and 44; Chidester, D., Systems, S., (1996) Colonialism and Comparative Religion in Southern Africa.

While politically active in the Organizations of the National Front Abroad, they gradually turned to revolutionary Marxism against the backdrop of the torrential waves of decolonization and resistance to imperial military interventions undulating across the Global South. This same constellation of activists was not only fiercely anti-imperialist, but also opposed any form of dependence on the U.S.S.R. or the People’s Republic of China. They would move from Europe and the United States to establish themselves in several locations across the Arab world, and pursue political activism and their advocacy of guerrilla warfare, as part of their ambition to launch a national liberation struggle against the Pahlavi regime. By examining Communist Unity’s predecessors and their manifold transnational ideological, political and logistical networks with like-minded revolutionary movements inside the Middle East, this article brings to the fore hitherto under-explored South–South connections, and situates Iran’s revolutionary opposition within the global moment of ‘1968’. © 2017 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.",,"colonialism; decolonization; historical perspective; ideology; Marxism; political history; political system; Iran",,,,,,,,,"Routledge",,,,,13530194,,,,"English","Br.

Our objective is thus to consider “South–South” flows of volunteers in order to provide a counter to dominant North–South imaginaries of international volunteering. However, we do not declare or celebrate South–South volunteering as “new”, rather our approach critically engages with the framing of this geography of international volunteering as offering benefits similar to those of wider South–South development cooperation. Drawing on interviews with volunteers and stakeholders in South–South volunteering, we draw out and explore three prominent themes: (1) how volunteers echo some of the wider discursive formulations of South–South development cooperation premised on commonalities within the global South; (2) how these commonalities meet limits at which a heterogeneity of the South is articulated through hierarchical orderings of relations between Southern constituents; and (3) the ways that racialised development imaginaries bring challenges to South–South volunteers. We thus argue that South–South volunteering works, re-works and contests established imaginaries of development, and their construction and ordering of sameness and difference. We argue further that caution is needed around claims of “newness” of, or unqualified advocacy for, South–South volunteering, which instead needs to be subject to critical attention in the areas we highlight.

Examining the use of humour (jokes, sarcasm, banter, and clowning) in social action research reveal creative ways that advocates and activists can challenge systems of normalcy. This paper examines humour as an informal conversational and non-confrontational strategy used by (non)disabled Indigenous women to support the creation of schools for disabled students. Thematic analysis of the data shows that the women’s use of humour supports their agenda of transforming exclusive structures in education and policy. Using humour as an organising strategy also shifts mainstream thinking about disabled people as easy targets of offensive and degrading humour. The paper explores humour as an organising strategy that provides new supports into inclusive spaces for the education of disabled people in the global South. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ableist; disability; humour; joking; Sāmoa",,,,,,,"Albrecht, G.L., Disability Humor: What’s in a Joke?

In the absence of direct engagement with EJ theory in much of the e-waste research on Agbogbloshie, the article probes how and to what extent the ""environmental justice framework"" fits in this postcolonial and toxic urban space. In particular, we examine and problematize the conventional EJ framing-developed countries dumping waste on vulnerable communities in the global south-that underwrites the research and advocacy work on the e-waste problem in Agbogbloshie. In doing so, we contend that an important dimension of the EJ challenge at Agbogbloshie is that conceptions of injustice and thus interventions are geared toward amending the visible aspect of harm from e-waste processing without considering the broader postcolonial terrain of plural injustices and violence producing the toxic urban landscape of Agbogbloshie in the first place. Consequently, as Ghana explores a sustainable e-waste policy, we argue for engagements with what we term a ""situated e-waste justice""; a contextualized EJ frame that recognizes the differences and histories implicated in producing a landscape of violence and toxicity as evidenced and experienced in Agbogbloshie. © 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Agbogbloshie; E-waste; e-waste justice; environmental justice; Ghana","advocacy; electronic waste; environmental issue; environmental justice; environmental policy; research work; sustainability; urban area; vulnerability; Agbogbloshie; Ghana; Greater Accra",,,,,,"Jack, C., Clark, E.E., Fuller, R., Lambertson, C., Assessing worker and environmental chemical exposure risks at an e-waste recycling and disposal site in Accra, Ghana (2011) Journal of Health and Pollution, 1, pp. 16-25; Jack, C., Clarke, E.E., Osei, C.S., Yaw, A.-O., Exploratory health assessment of chemical exposures at e-waste recycling and scrapyard facility in Ghana (2013) Journal of Health and Pollution, 3, pp. 11-22; Vincent, N.K., Klaus, G., Atiemo, S.M., Spatial assessment of soil contamination by heavy metals from informal electronic waste recycling in agbogbloshie, Ghana (2016) Environmental Health and Toxicology, 31, p.

This article evaluates political network theory through the case study of the transnational lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) advocacy network. Through interviews with key figures at human rights and LGBTQ NGOs, I suggest that the transnational LGBTQ network emerged through contestation with the human rights gatekeeper, Amnesty International, and its US section, AIUSA. This process of contestation would produce a specific type of gatekeeper activism that would become a defining feature of the network. Over time, the network would evolve from a collection of national groups engaging in direct action to a highly professional and international network with a dual focus on movement building in the Global South and the advancement of LGBTQ rights at the United Nations. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,,,,,,"Altman, D., On global queering (1996) Australian Humanities Review, , 2(July-August); Altman, D., Symons, J., (2016) Queer Wars, , Cambridge, UK: Polity, and; (1982) Report from Working Party A: “Strategy” Plenary Session, , 15th International Council, Rimini, Italy; (1982) Report of the International Executive Committee to the 15th International Council 1982.

The Declaration had over 120 signatories from India and other countries in the Global South within first two weeks of its pronouncement. This declaration is supported by the Knowledge Societies Division of UNESCO; IFLA RSCAO; Forum for Open Access in SAARC, etc. The signatories are not limited to the information professionals, journal editors, and research funders, but also the committed academic researchers who use and promote open access resources. The Declaration also marked the sixteenth anniversary of Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), which is considered as the starting point in the shaping of the global open access movement2. On the 15th anniversary of BOAI, the AgriXiv, a preprint self-archiving portal for agriculture and allied sciences was launched as an Open Access India's community initiative. © 2018, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

A Gender and Development rubric typically frames knowledge about relations of gender in the Global South. Men enter this conversation as threats to modernizing gender systems in developing countries. In fact, calls for men’s inclusion in gender and development policy and programming have highlighted men’s power brokering as the reason for their inclusion, with arguments that seem more concerned with programme efficacy - the instrumental engagement with men to ensure their support for development initiatives - than with challenging masculinist relations of power. Using the narratives of five activist men from four English-speaking Caribbean countries, this chapter complicates discussions on men as partners for gender equality in the Global South. It investigates men’s contradictory consciousness embedded in the polyvocality of the men’s narratives; and the multiple, competing and contested ways in which they position themselves relative to other men, to gender equality activism and to women and feminist activists. It is attentive to both the residual coloniality of this discourse in the Caribbean, as well as the new ways that activist men shape advocacy aimed at producing more gender-just futures. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Jeff Hearn, Ernesto Vasquez del Aguila and Marina Hughson; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,,,,"Andaiye, The Angle You Look from Determines What You See: Towards a Critique of Feminist Politics in the Caribbean (2002) The Lucille Mathurin Mair Lecture, , The Old Library, University of the West Indies, Mona: Centre for Gender and Development Studies; Baldwin, A., Caring for Those We Care About: The Alienating Power of Love in Anglophone Caribbean Middle Class, Heterosexual Relationships (2014) Doing Gender, Doing Love: Interdisciplinary Voices, pp. 123-149. , edited by Serena Petrella, Oxford: Inter-Disciplinary Press; Bannon, I., Correia, M.C., (2012) The Other Half of Gender: Men’s Issues in Development, , Washington DC: World Bank; Bedford, K., Holding It Together in a Crisis: Family Strengthening and Embedding Neoliberalism (2008) IDS Bulletin, 39 (6), pp. 60-66; Bernal, V., Grewal, I., (2014) Theorizing NGOs, States, Feminisms, and Neoliberalism, , Durham NC: Duke University Press; Chant, S., From “Woman-Blind” to “Man-Kind”: Should Men Have More Space in Gender and Development?

Women’s rights organisations (WROs) and feminists groups, including African Women's Development and Communications Network (FEMNET), followed this process closely and put forward clear demands related to achieving women’s rights and gender equality. Today, FEMNET and other WROs celebrate the gains made and continue to be at the forefront of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in order to sustain and monitor the realisation of the gains made. Although this Agenda has been hailed as transformative and one that has potential to transform the lives of girls and women everywhere if fully implemented, its potential for transformation by itself is largely dependent on a number of factors, particularly in Africa and the Global South to address both its limitations and to push forward its gains. The major limitations include its nature of being voluntary and non-binding, the current international political environment, including growing religious fundamentalism, corporate power and its involvement in the 2030 agenda, limited resourcing especially for WROs in the Global South and the failure of the 2030 Agenda to address structural barriers to gender equality and equality between countries in the Global South and North. For example, illicit financial flows, inequalities in international trade and the entire macro-economic policies architecture remain obstacles in the way of achieving gender equality in Africa. This article will share a feminist perspective of the 2030 Agenda and its implementation by highlighting its gains and missed opportunities. It will further offer recommendations on how the highlighted limitations can be addressed to advance the achievement of gender equality, women’s and girls’ human rights and empowerment of girls and women in Africa. It will draw from my experience of African women’s engagement in various processes, both regionally and globally, leading to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the follow up mechanisms after adoption. © 2018 Dinah Musindarwezo.","2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; African feminism/s; African women; gender equality; global inequalities",,,,,,,"(2003), http://www.achpr.org/instruments/women-protocol/, Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women Africa (Maputo Protocol), Adopted by the 2nd Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the Union, Maputo, 11 July, : [site accessed 22 November 2017]; (2015) Conference of Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development, Report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa, , Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,) ‘, ’; Balakrishnan, R., McGowan, L., Waters, C., (2016) Transforming Women’s Work: Policies for an Inclusive Economic Agenda, , New Jersey, USA: Rutgers Center for Womens Global Leadership; Correa, S., Petchesky, R., Health, empowerment, and rights (1994) Population Policies Reconsidered, , Sen G., Germain A., Chen L.C., (eds), Boston, Massachusetts: Harvard University, Harvard Center for Population and Development Studies, &,) ‘, ’ (eds; Elson, D., Balakrishnan, R., (2012) The Post-2015 Development Framework and the Realization of Women's Rights and Social Justice, , New Jersey, USA: Rutgers: Center for Womens Global Leadership; History of the 2030 Agenda, , http://feministallianceforrights.org/blog/2017/01/24/2030-agenda-history/, [accessed 1 December 2017],) ‘, ’; (2012) Communiqué from the Africa Women’s Regional Civil Society Consultation on the Post-2015 Development Framework in Monrovia, Liberia, October 2012, , Nairobi, Kenya: African Women’s Development and Communication Network (FEMNET),) ‘, ’; (2012) Mind the gap’ position paper of African women on the Post-2015 Development Framework, , Nairobi, Kenya: FEMNET,) ‘‘, ’; (2015), African Civil Society Beijing + 20 Shadow Report, Nairobi, Kenya: FEMNET; (2016) No woman will be left behind as FEMNET rolls out forums on Sustainable Development Goals, , http://femnet.org/2016/06/08/no-woman-will-be-left-behind-as-femnet-rolls-out-forums-on-sustainable-development-goals/, Press release, June 8, : [site accessed 22 November 2017],) ‘, ’; (2017) Gender dimensions of macro-economic policies, , Research report, Nairobi, Kenya: FEMNET,) ‘, ’; (2017) Africa must close the macroeconomics gender gap to achieve sustainable development, , http://femnet.org/2017/10/09/africa-must-close-the-macroeconomics-gender-gap-to-achieve-sustainable-development/, 9 October 2017, Press release, FEMNET, : [site accessed 22 November 2017],) ‘, ’; (2017) Power Lessons: Women’s advocacy and the 2030 Agenda, , New York, USA: International Women’s Health Coalition,) ‘, ’; Nadal, K.L., (2013) That's So Gay!

The roundtable undoubtedly demonstrated a commitment to social justice by panelists and participants; it also raised an important question: “How do we incorporate social justice into existing frameworks, institutional contexts, and disciplinary contexts?"" How we answer this question depends on how we define social justice and our economic, social, and political realities and ways of understanding the world. It also depends on how our commitments and ideologies interact with systems, institutions, methodologies, norms, and values. We have all been there-that place where our idealism is confronted with a brick wall of exigency. The place where doing the right thing, like advocating for the voiceless, seems to be at odds with getting the job or the funding. We tend to think of social justice as involving big decisions, but we forget that our everyday work comprises micro-decision points, and that these micro-decision points can be leveraged as advocacy moments. Let me offer a brief example. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"Arduser, L., Durá, L., Malkowski, J., Rhetorical agency in the face of uncertainty (2015) POROI, 11 (1), pp. 1-8; Bazerman, C., (1999) The languages of Edison’s light., , Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Blythe, S., Grabill, J., Riley, K., Action research and wicked environmental problems: Exploring appropriate roles for researchers in professional communication (2008) Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 22 (3), pp. 272-298; HAI data and statistics (2016) Healthcare associated infections., , www.cdc.gov/hai/surveillance, Retrieved from; Cooperrider, D., Whitney, D., Stavros, J., (2008) Appreciative Inquiry handbook, , 2nd Ed.

It begins by considering our understanding of the diplomatic process broadly defined. From there, it maps how state diplomacy has become enmeshed with the Paralympic Games, while at the same time, from the perspective of multi-stakeholder diplomacy, the activities of the IPC as a disability rights advocacy body has been expanding. The chapter assesses these developments in the context of events relating to the London, Sochi and Rio Paralympic Games. It concludes by outlining the possible future trajectory for diplomacy as it relates to various actors within the Paralympic Movement. This includes efforts by the IPC to develop its international profile through, for example, responses to the global north-global south resourcing gap and an increasingly assertive approach to management of its relationship with the IOC. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2018.",,,,,,,,"Allison, L., (1993) The Changing Politics of Sport, , Manchester: Manchester University Press; Allison, L., (2005) The Global Politics of Sport: The Role of Global Institutions in Sport, , London: Routledge; Beacom, A., (2012) International Diplomacy and The Olympic Movement: The New Mediators, , Basingstoke: Palgrave; Beacom, A., Brittain, I., Public Diplomacy and the IPC: Reconciling the Roles of Disability Advocate and Sports Regulator (2016) Diplomacy and Statecraft, 27 (2), pp. 273-294. , https://doi.org/10.1080/09592296.20l6.1l69795; International Inspiration, , https://www.britishcouncil.org/soci-ety/sport/current-programmes/international-inspiration, Accessed 26 September 2015; Brittain, I., Paralympic Success as a Measure of National Social and Economic Development (2006) International Journal of Eastern Sport and Physical Education, 4 (1), pp. 38-47; Brittain, I., South Africa, Apartheid and the Paralympic Games (2011) Sport in Society, 14 (9), pp. 1167-1183; Brittain, I., (2014) From Stoke Mandeville to Sochi: A History of the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games, , Champaign, IL: Common Ground Publishing; Brittain, I., Beacom, A., Leveraging Paralympic Legacy (2016) Journal of Sport and Social Issues, 40 (6), pp. 499-521. , https://doi.org/10.1177/0193723516655580; (2007) China Signs UN Accord on Disability Rights, March 31, , http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/31/content_840971.htm; Cooper, A., English, J., Thakur, R., (2002) Enhancing Global Governance: Towards a New Diplomacy?, , Tokyo: United Nations Press; Craft, A., Horton, P., Toohey, K., It Comes with the Territory: Terrorism and the Paralympics (2008) The Paralympic Games: Empowerment Or Sideshow?, p. 195. , ed.

New employment opportunities, however, have been under-pinned by poverty wages and inhumane working conditions as states ‘race to the bottom’ in terms of labour rights and regulations in order to be competitive and attract capital investment. Labour agency at the bottom of transnational supply chains is often said to be structurally powerless because of the international mobility of capital. The ‘boomerang effect’ has often been presented as a remedy that increases local bargaining power in the global South by mobilizing consumer pressure in the global North through multi-stakeholder initiatives or transnational advocacy networks. The problem with this perspective is that it overstates the Northern dimension of this transnational politics and underestimates the local power base of Southern trade unions and labour movements. The incipient debate about Networks of Labour Activism (NOLA) aims to overcome this Northern bias. This article contributes to this debate by highlighting some of the limitations and unintended effects of multi-stakeholder initiatives and taking a closer look at the Play Fair alliance and the ‘Freedom of Association Protocol’ in Indonesia's athletic footwear industry. © 2017 International Institute of Social Studies",,"capital; employment; labor policy; poverty; stakeholder; trade union; wage; working conditions; China; Indonesia",,,,,,"Albo, G., The Crisis of Neoliberalism and the Impasse of the Union Movement (2009) Development Dialogue, 51, pp. 119-131; Bartley, T., Egels-Zandén, N., Beyond Decoupling: Unions and the Leveraging of Corporate Social Responsibility in Indonesia (2016) Socio-Economic Review, 14 (2), pp. 231-255; Behrens, M., Hamann, K., Hurd, R., Conceptualizing Labour Union Revitalization (2006) Varieties of Unionism: Strategies for Union Revitalization in a Globalizing Economy, pp. 11-29. , in, C.M.

This is significant because, in Zimbabwe, as in many other countries in the Global South, people with epilepsy encounter several barriers in a context of less-than-ideal public services. Despite this disadvantage, some people with epilepsy have better employment outcomes for reasons including level of seizure control, social background, employment support services, and individual resilience. This article reports on data from participants (n = 8), who were part of a larger study (n = 30) on employment experiences of people with epilepsy in Harare. The study used in-depth interviews with the participants, who were all service users and members of the Epilepsy Support Foundation (ESF) in Harare. The eight resilient participants comprised four males and four females aged between 26-48 years, who were selected because, unlike the remaining 22 participants, they had overcome chronic unemployment. Seven of the eight participants were employed, while one had recently become unemployed. Views of service providers (n = 7) were sought on the experiences of people with epilepsy through a focus group discussion. The service providers included two health workers, three social service workers, and two disability advocacy workers. Data were analysed using NVivo, a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis package. The study found that participants experienced barriers, such as a lack of medical treatment, yet this was important for education and training, lack of finances for training, and negative attitudes at workplaces. Despite these barriers, participants had overcome chronic unemployment due to their individual resilience characterised by: (i) a ‘fighting spirit’, (ii) being their own advocates, and (iii) having a mastery over, and acceptance of, their epilepsy. The research concluded that, where people with epilepsy faced barriers, as in Zimbabwe, individual resilience acted as a strong coping mechanism that resulted in better employment outcomes. This suggested service providers should strengthen resilience-building initiatives and make them more accessible to people with epilepsy. However, this is only a coping mechanism that should not stop service providers and service users from advocating for government-provided employment services. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Employment; Epilepsy; Individual resilience; Zimbabwe","adult; Article; clinical article; coping behavior; disability; disease association; employment discrimination; epilepsy; experience; female; human; male; psychological resilience; social acceptance; social attitude; social work; strategic planning; unemployment; workplace; Zimbabwe; attitude; coping behavior; employment; information processing; middle aged; unemployment; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Attitude; Employment; Epilepsy; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Resilience, Psychological; Unemployment; Zimbabwe",,,,,,"WHO, Epilepsy (2016), http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs999/en/, Available from: (on 16 October 2016); Mielke, J., Sebit, M., Adamolekun, B., The impact of epilepsy on the quality of life of people with epilepsy in Zimbabwe: a pilot study (2000) Seizure, 9 (4), pp. 259-264; Mugumbate, J., Nyanguru, A., Measuring the challenges of people with epilepsy in Harare (2013) Zimbab Neurol Asia, 18 (1), pp. 29-33; Mugumbate, J., Mushonga, J., Myths, perceptions, and incorrect knowledge surrounding epilepsy in rural Zimbabwe: a study of the villagers in Buhera District (2013) Epilepsy Behav, 27 (1), pp. 144-147; Dewa, E., January, J., Nyati-Jokomo, Z., Mafaune, P.T., Muteti, S., Maradzika, J., Non-attendance of treatment review visits among epileptic patients in a rural district, Zimbabwe (2014) J Public Health Afr, 5 (2), pp. 73-76; Vyas, M.V., Wong, A., Yang, J.M., Thistle, P., Lee, L., The spectrum of neurological presentations in an outpatient clinic of rural Zimbabwe (2016) J Neurol Sci, 362, pp. 263-265; Mielke, J., Adamolekun, B., Ball, D., Mundanda, T., Knowledge and attitudes of teachers towards epilepsy in Zimbabwe (1997) Acta Neurol Scand, 96 (3), pp. 133-137; Saburi, G., Stressors of caregivers of school-age children with epilepsy and use of community resources (2011) Neurosci Nurs, 43 (3), pp. 1-12; Mielke, J., Madzokere, C., Epilepsy care in rural Zimbabwe: a global campaign against epilepsy project (2005) Epilepsia, 46, p. 347; Richardson, C.E., The metatheory of resilience and resiliency (2002) J Clin Psychol, 58 (3), pp. 307-321; Munn, Z., Care delivery and self-management strategies for adults with epilepsy (2008) J Adv Nurs, 64, pp. 455-456; Day, K., Quality of life: the role of psychological resilience (2008), University of Edinburgh Edinburgh; Ring, A., Jacob, A., Baker, G., Marson, A., Whitehead, M., Does the concept of resilience contribute to understanding good quality of life in the context of epilepsy?

We elaborate on this argument through a study of Indian civil society mobilization around climate change. Five key mechanisms contribute to crowding-in processes: (1) the expansion of discursive opportunities; (2) the event effects of global climate change conferences; (3) the network effects created by expanding global civil society networks; (4) the adoption and innovation of action repertoires; and (5) global pressure effects creating new opportunities for civil society. Our findings contribute to the world society literature, with an account of the social mechanisms through which global institutions and political events affect national civil societies, and to the social movements literature by showing that developments in world society are essential contributors to national mobilization processes. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2017","Civil society; climate change; environmental social movements; India; social mechanisms; world society","climate change; consumer advocacy; factual database; human; human relation; India; interview; mass medium; non profit organization; politics; public relations; social network; voluntary program; Climate Change; Consumer Advocacy; Databases, Factual; Humans; India; Interpersonal Relations; Interprofessional Relations; Interviews as Topic; Mass Media; Organizations, Nonprofit; Politics; Social Networking; Voluntary Programs",,,,,,"Agarwal, A., Narain, S., (1991) Global Warming in an Unequal World: A Case of Environmental Colonialism, , New Delhi, CSE; (2010) The National People's Tribunal on the Climate Crisis, , http://www.oxfamindia.org/sites/default/files/NATIONAL%20PEOPLES%20TRIBUNAL%20ON%20CLIMATE%20CRISIS.pdf, ‘’, press release, [Accessed April 2015]; Bosi, L., Demetriou, C., Malthaner, S., ‘A Contentious Politics Approach to the Explanation of Rationalization’ (2014) Dynamics of Political Violence, pp. 1-26. , in, L.

With a view to close this research gap, the article empirically assesses the assumption that TMNs are a viable substitute for ambitious international action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It addresses the aggregate phenomenon in terms of geographical distribution, central players, mitigation ambition and monitoring provisions. Examining thirteen networks, it finds that membership in TMNs is skewed toward Europe and North America while countries from the Global South are underrepresented; that only a minority of networks commit to quantified emission reductions and that these are not more ambitious than Parties to the UNFCCC; and finally that the monitoring provisions are fairly limited. In sum, the article shows that transnational municipal networks are not (yet) the representative, ambitious and transparent player they are thought to be. © 2016, The Author(s).","Cities and regions; Climate change; Transnational networks; Urban politics","advocacy; climate change; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental policy; global change; governance approach; international relations; regional planning; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; urban politics; Europe; North America",,,,,,"Acuto, M., The new climate leaders (2013) Review of International Studies, 39 (4), pp. 835-857; (2015) National greenhouse gas inventory—Kyoto protocol accounting framework.

Durham: Duke University Press, 2012, p. 9). NCDs are a composite category of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, cancer and diabetes grouped together by virtue of four shared risk factors (tobacco, alcohol, unhealthy diets and sedentarism). While infectious diseases spread through viruses or bacteria under conditions of contagion that can provoke fear, disgust, suspicion and irrationality amid physical suffering and high mortality rates, NCDs have too often been met with ennui. This paper draws on the concept of charisma to help explore and explain the 'neglected epidemic' of NCDs in the global south through four themes: The lexicon used to describe, frame and communicate NCDs; risk factors and culpability; the temporality of disease and its embodiment. In conclusion, the paper reflects on how to activate the latent charismatic potential of NCDs in the global south. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","advocacy; charisma; credibility; global health; Noncommunicable disease",,,,,,,"Adams, V., Evidence-based global public health: Subjects, profits, erasures (2013) When People Come First: Critical Studies in Global Public Health, pp. 54-90. , In J.

They are a common fixture of employment in cities. Organisations of informal workers have developed as important players in urban policy spaces as they seek to address the issues their members face. Informal workers face a major challenge of legitimacy in urban policy. Being seen as a marginal, even illegal, workforce, performing incidental economic activities and forming an obstacle to growth, has worked against their participation and representation in urban policy processes. This chapter reviews informal worker organisations in urban settings. It explores why and how informal worker organisations have formed transnational networks for global advocacy and examines how they have combined global and local advocacy to achieve changes in city planning practices in three urban areas: home-based workers in Bangkok, Thailand; street vendors in Delhi, India; and waste pickers in Bogotá, Colombia. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Gautam Bhan, Smita Srinivas and Vanessa Watson.",,,,,,,,"Bonner, C., Carré, F., (2013) Global networking: Informal workers build solidarity, power, and representation through networks and alliances, , http://wiego.org/sites/wiego.org/files/publications/files/Bonner-Global-Networking-Informal-Workers-WIEGO-WP31.pdf, WIEGO Working Paper No. 31.

Despite the rise of democratic regimes, in many contexts restrictions on civic space are increasing including the growing power of business over the state. These trends have in many ways curtailed ""people power"". Within this context, the human rights movement has had to find new ways of organising, notably by strengthening the power and voice of human rights organisations in the Global South, so that human rights as an approach and way of working are evident in the way the movement itself operates. This article, based on the review of The Ford Foundation's Strengthening Human Rights Worldwide global initiative, offers examples of how a number of Global South actors are responding to this new reality. © 2017 Sur - Rede Universitaria de Direitos Humanos.","Advocacy; Global south; International NGO; Movements; Power",,,,,,,"Goñi, U., Santiago Maldonado: Missing Backpacker Takes Center Stage in Argentina's Elections (2017) The Guardian, , https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/06/santiago-maldonado-argentina-election-missing-backpacker, October 6, accessed October 31, 2017; Macri, M., Argentina Finds Body Thought to be Santiago Maldonado (2017) Al Jazeera, , http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/argentina-finds-body-thought-santiago-maldonado-171018222534259.html, October 18, accessed October 31, 2017; IACHR Grants Protection Measure for Santiago Maldonado in Argentina (2017) OAS, , http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2017/125.asp, August 23, accessed October 31, 2017; Urgent Action: Forced Disappearance in Mapuche Community (Argentina: UA 191.17) (2017) Amnesty International, , https://www.amnestyusa.org/urgent-actions/urgent-action-forced-disappearance-in-mapuche-community-argentina-ua-191-17/, September 18, accessed October 31, 2017; Vivanco, J.M., Disappearance of Protestor in Argentina (2017) Human Rights Watch, , https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/08/16/disappearance-protestor-argentina, August 16, accessed October 31, 2017; Abregu, M., Strengthening Global Human Rights Initiative (2017) Convening, , Greentree, New York, July 11; Global Action-Research Workshop for Global South Activists (2017) Dejusticia, , https://www.dejusticia.org/en/education/global-action-research-workshop-for-global-south-activists/, June 15, accessed October 31, 2017; Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons (2016) PHR, INCLO, , https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/lethal-in-disguise.pdf, March, accessed October 31, 2017; Anger as State Shuts Down Another NGO in Crackdown (2017) Standard Digital, , https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001251504/anger-as-state-shuts-down-another-ngo-in-crackdown, August 16, accessed October 31, 2017; Landmark Ruling Provides Major Victory to Kenya's Indigenous Endorois (2010) Minority Rights, , http://minorityrights.org/publications/landmark-ruling-provides-major-victory-to-kenyas-indigenous-endorois-august-2010/, August 26, accessed October 31, 2017; First Meeting of the Kenyan Task Force for the Implementation of the Endorois Decision (2014) ESCR-Net, , https://www.escr-net.org/news/2014/first-meeting-kenyan-task-force-implementation-endorois-decision, November 24, accessed October 31, 2017; Paris Climate Change Conference-November 2015 (2015) UNFCCC, , http://unfccc.int/meetings/paris_nov_2015/meeting/8926.php, November, accessed October 31, 2017; Advancing Human Rights: Update on Global Foundation Grantmaking (2017) Foundation Center and the International Human Rights Funders Group, , http://humanrightsfunding.org/report-2017/, accessed October 31, 2017",,,"Sur - Rede Universitaria de Direitos Humanos",,,,,18066445,,,,"English","Sur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085652878

Understanding teachers’ attitudes, motivations and barriers to OER use and comparing data across institutions may help to identify the issues that influence OER uptake in India. This chapter attempts to answer the following four research questions: How are teachers’ attitudes towards OER situated in the context of teaching and learning? What are teachers’ motivations for using OER and sharing their work as OER? How do teachers perceive the quality of OER? What barriers to using OER do teachers perceive? This study employed a mixed methods approach, using a survey to gather the quantitative data which form the focus of this chapter, as well as workshop engagements and interviews to collect qualitative data. The research was carried out at four universities representing the varying contexts of higher education teachers in India – one state, open university; one dual-mode university; one semi–urban university; and one multi-campus, private university – and amongst the WikiEducator India community. At each university, a three-day OER workshop took place where 30 teachers learned about OER and completed a survey. In addition to the 120 workshop participants engaged at the four universities, the survey was sent to the 107 members of the WikiEducator India community who participated in the research process. Of the total of 227 teachers who were asked to take the survey, 149 survey responses were received, of which 117 (comprised of 43% females and 57% males) were useable. A total of 28 educators from the universities were also interviewed. ⊓ 425 Adoption and Impact of OER in the Global South 426 Despite the relatively low levels of awareness of OER demonstrated by Indian teachers prior to the research process, they were very positive about creating and sharing OER, while being slightly less enthusiastic about using externally developed materials. Many of the positive attitudes stemmed from: the sense of satisfaction obtained when others use and adapt their materials; useful feedback received from peers; increased reputational profile experienced as a result of sharing; collaborative opportunities introduced in the sharing process; and the belief that their own sharing would encourage other teachers to do the same. The teachers were mildly cautious about OER quality issues, but said that they would use OER if they were appropriate for their needs. They acknowledged a number of barriers to using and sharing OER, including a lack of understanding of intellectual property, copyright and open licensing; a lack of time; and the lack of funding, institutional incentives and support for OER activities. The authors recommend that advocacy to raise awareness of OER in Indian universities should be a top priority, with a particular focus on teachers and senior administrators; teachers should be released from certain duties and provided with the time required to engage in OER activity; incentives in the form of awards and/or recognition in promotion should be provided for teachers to undertake OER development; quality assurance mechanisms for OER produced should be introduced; and continuous professional development opportunities should be provided to teachers through regular workshops and training sessions on advanced information and communication technologies and OER skills.

In order to address reform of the higher education system, the Indian government’s National Knowledge Commission recommended upgrading infrastructure, improving the training of teachers, and continuous assessment of syllabi and examination systems (Pitroda, 2006). In 2008, the Commission called for a national e–content and curriculum initiative to stimulate the creation, adaptation and utilisation of Open Educational Resources (OER) by Indian higher education institutions (HEIS), and to leverage OER produced outside… © Contributors 2017.

The 18 sub-projects that comprise the larger project investigated the extent of OER adoption by educators and students; the factors influencing OER adoption; and the impact of OER adoption on access to educational resources, the quality of teaching and learning, and some of the costs of education provision in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. The findings of each of the sub-projects are discussed in the various chapters comprising this volume, and a meta-synthesis of these findings is presented in Chapter 2. Using a social realist lens, the meta-synthesis provides a comparative analysis of OER use, adaptation and creation across the research sites, and identifies the structural, cultural and agential factors that enable and constrain these Open Educational Practices (OEP). It points out disjunctures in adoption processes in the countries and institutions studied, and draws insights regarding the extent to which OER adoption can expand access to educational materials, enhance the quality of educational resources and educators’ pedagogical perspectives and practices, and improve the affordability and sustainability of education in the Global South. This concluding chapter explores the implications of the main research findings presented in the meta-synthesis for the attainment of social inclusion, which lies at the heart of the Open Education movement. The Paris OER Declaration of 20121 explicitly calls upon states to “[p]romote and use OER to contribut[e] to social inclusion, gender equity and special needs education [and i]mprove both cost-efficiency and quality of teaching and learning outcomes”2 (emphasis added). The Ljubljana OER Action Plan of 20173 likewise recognises that, “[t]oward the realization of inclusive Knowledge Societies [OER] support quality education that is equitable, inclusive, open and participatory”. Understanding how OER, OEP and Open Education more generally, can help to achieve social inclusion is particularly critical in the Global South where increased demand, lack of resources and high costs limit the capacity of education systems to provide accessible, relevant, highquality and affordable education. This chapter aims to contribute to this understanding the 1 http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/WPFD2009/English_Declaration.html 2 http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/English_Paris_OER_Declaration.pdf 3 https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/ljubljana_oer_action_plan_2017.pdf 579 OER and OEP in the Global South: Implications and recommendations for social inclusion potential of OER and their accompanying OEP through a critical exploration of the ROER4D findings in terms of whether and how OER adoption promotes equitable access, participatory education and empowerment of teachers and students, and thus helps to achieve social inclusion. The chapter begins with a brief overview of the relationship between OER and social inclusion, details the implications of ROER4Ds findings as they pertain to social inclusion, and concludes with recommendations for advocacy, policy, practice and further research in OER and OEP in the Global South. Social inclusion Social inclusion refers to ‟the process of improving the terms for individuals and groups to take part in society It ensures that people have a voice in decisions which affect their lives and that they enjoy equal access to markets, services and political, social and physical spaces.4 The process assumes that people face some level of social exclusion – a complex reality that may be influenced by factors of ‟socio-economic status, culture (including indigenous cultures), linguistic group, religion, geography (rural and remote/isolated), gender, sexual orientation, age (including youth and old age), physical and mental health/ability, and status with regard to unemployment, homelessness and incarceration (Gidley, Hampson, Wheeler Bereded-Samuel, 2010, p.1). OER advocates have approached the relationship between OER and social inclusion in different ways.

The study, conducted with public school teachers in southwestern Colombia, used a Participatory Action Research approach, in which the object of study is not external to the researchers, as the social practices under study are performed by the same subjects who are conducting the investigation. This allows teachers to identify possibilities of OER in their own educational practices, as well as the conditions required for their adoption, based on collective thinking processes immersed in their own sociocultural contexts. A call for research participation was issued to teachers who were experienced in using information and communication technologies (ICT) in their teaching. The data collection process was undertaken through administration of a series of online questionnaires (completed by 19 teachers), a survey (completed by 248 teachers), webinars (in which 28 teachers connected and 14 participated actively), unstructured telephone interviews (with 30 teachers) and a series of focus group discussions (with a cohort of 49 teacher educators, teachers and students). A face-to-face workshop was also conducted with teachers to provide an introduction to OER, after which they identified challenges to incorporating OER into their pedagogical practices and discussed their own OER-related activities. 143 Adoption and Impact of OER in the Global South 144 Data analysis followed a rigorous Grounded Theory process and involved an “approach stage” to identify key teacher practices; a “deepening stage” to uncover relationships and affinities; and a “condensation phase” to surface a theory of change. The main finding in this study is that teachers create and use OER more effectively when they receive flexible and continuous pedagogical support that: (1) fosters pedagogical practices drawing upon constructivist models, so that teachers and students have an active role in the creation and recreation of knowledge; (2) promotes open licensing that respects authors’ rights, but allows for legal reuse and adaptation; and (3) facilitates the use of ICT available in schools and at home to access, create and share OER. Similarly, it was found that this pedagogical support generated better outcomes when teacher teams work around a project in their schools instead of attending general training sessions on OER. The key recommendation is that pedagogical support be provided to encourage team-based teacher OER development projects within schools.

There is a global commitment to develop these new social skills in order to achieve effective and efficient management of knowledge through information and communication technologies (ICT). In the field of education, particularly in Latin America, ICT-related policies have been proposed from three perspectives: (1) economic: to be competitive as a nation to achieve greater prosperity and quality of life; (2) social: closing digital gaps to reduce social divides, and expanding the possibilities of participation in an interconnected world; and (3) educational: changing teaching practices to… © Contributors 2017.

It addresses three questions: How do the higher education systems of Chile, Colombia and Uruguay operate and fund their activities in general? How do existing policies and processes incorporating Open Access and/or OER influence student access to learning and research materials in these countries? What policy, advocacy and community-building interventions might be useful for promoting Open Education activities in these contexts? This study employed a descriptive, case study approach to examine whether and how Open Access and OER policies have been applied at national and institutional levels. It first engaged in an Open Education policy country-mapping exercise, then conducted a comparative analysis, and concluded the research process with a workshop conducted with 10 regional education experts and activists to validate findings. Findings indicate that while each country has its own approach to funding higher education, there are few or no specific national and/or institutional policies aimed at promoting Open Education in the higher education sectors. Low OER awareness and a commercialised model of higher education appear to account for the lack of any OER policies in Chile, while in Colombia various national and institutional strategies reveal a country at a nascent stage of Open Education policy development. By contrast, the nature of OER management and extent of policy implementation in Uruguay suggests that it is an enabling environment for current and future open policy development. ⊓ 121 Adoption and Impact of OER in the Global South 122 All of these countries are making investments in science, technology and innovation programmes and projects, making this the most fruitful field for potential Open Education advocacy. Based on the outcomes of this study, a number of recommendations are proposed, including: fostering and strengthening networks among Latin American civil society organisations promoting Open Education; engaging with higher education stakeholders on how to develop open policies; promoting open policies and mandates for publicly funded research; developing bottom-up and top-down strategies for greater engagement with OER; and providing greater visibility to existing Open Education projects in the region.

Within this context, increased investment in and focus upon higher education is a key element in the pursuit of more equitable societies.

These challenges include: unequal access to education; variable quality of educational resources, teaching, and student performance; and increasing cost and concern about the sustainability of education. The Research on Open Educational Resources for Development (ROER4D) project seeks to build on and contribute to the body of research on how OER can help to improve access, enhance quality and reduce the cost of education in the Global South. This volume examines aspects of educator and student adoption of OER and engagement in Open Educational Practices (OEP) in secondary and tertiary education as well as teacher professional development in 21 countries in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia.

This ambition has generated unprecedented commitment of political support and financial funds for the forest-development sector. Many academics and people-centered advocacy organizations have conceptualized REDD+ as an example of “green grabbing” and have voiced fears of a potential global rush for land and trees. In this paper we argue that, in practice and up until now, REDD+ resembles longstanding dynamics of the development and conservation industry, where the promise of change becomes a discursive commodity that is constantly reproduced and used to generate value and appropriate financial resources. We thus argue for a re-conceptualization of REDD+ as a conservation fad within the broader political economy of development and conservation. We derive this argument from a study that compares the emergence of REDD+ in Tanzania with that of a previous forest-policy model called Participatory Forest Management. Our study describes how the advent of REDD+ implies change at the discursive level, but also continuity and repetitiveness in terms of the initial promises and expectations leading to substantial donor financing, pilot project activities, and policy development and implementation processes. In both epochs, these have achieved little in terms of changing actual forest management and use on the ground outside selected pilot project sites, but have sustained the livelihoods of actors within the development and conservation industry, including academics. Given that there are still many who look to REDD+ in the hope of addressing global climate change, despite less than hoped for financial support at the global level, our study provides an important starting point for questioning the uses of the finances for REDD+ that are actually amassed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Africa; conservation; development policy; forestry; REDD+","carbon emission; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; forest management; forestry; nature conservation; policy development; political economy; Tanzania",,,,,,"Agrawal, A., Nepstad, D., Chhatre, A., Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (2011) Annual Review of Environment and Resources, 36, pp. 373-396. , www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-042009-094508; Akida, A., Mnangwone, I., Lyimo, L., Financing for sustainable forest management in Tanzania: Country case study (2012), Indufor Oy Helsinki, Finland; Angelsen, A., Brockhaus, M., Sunderlin, W.D., Verchot, L.V., Chapter one: Introduction (2012) Analysing REDD+: Challenges and choices, pp. 1-12. , A.

Drawing on interviews with industry insiders, the article explores the industry's communicative agency in both the media sphere and key sites of power, with a focus on the European Union (EU) policy sphere. The analysis shows that the industry has focused primarily on maintaining access to policymakers and sustaining elite consensus around the existing global intellectual property rights regime through political communication activities that largely bypass mediated public arenas - from strategically promoting its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes and mobilizing third-party endorsement to direct lobbying. The article concludes by reflecting on the implications of the findings for critical investigations of the interplay between media and political power in relation to global economic governance. © 2016 SAGE Publications.","Communicative agency; corporate social responsibility; pharmaceutical industry; public relations",,,,,,,"Act, U.P., (2002) Accelerating 'Access' Serves Pharmaceutical Companies while Corrupting Health Organizations, , http://www.actupny.org/reports/Durban-accessPR.html, (accessed June 2015); Adamani, S., Maarse, H., Versluis, E., Policy-making on data exclusivity in the European Union: From industrial interests to legal realities (2009) Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law, 34 (6), pp. 979-1010; Allen, A., H&K awarded ABPI public affairs brief (2003) PR Week, p. 21. , http://www.prweek.com/article/170996/h-k-awarded-abpi-public-affairs-brief, (accessed June 2015); (2013) Client Success: International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, , http://www.apcoworldwide.com/, APCO Worldwide.

We advocate for reform by calling upon the industries to represent plus-sized and older models (e.g., on catwalks) as antidotes to narrow beauty ideals, citing evidence that the use of such models are no less profitable. This attempts to address what Fraser () calls the injustice of misrecognition. This advocacy however not only masks another injustice these industries perpetuate: maldistribution (Fraser,), but it can actively worsen it. This is most poignantly exemplified by the 250 million sweatshop workers in the Global South working in these industries. Those of us advocating against these industries' injustices are encouraged to join People and Planet in their campaign to use universities' vast purchasing power for sweatshop reform.

Indeed, the growth of evangelical Christianity continues unabated, especially in the global south. Evangelical Christianity's principal feature consist in its understanding of conversion, its advocacy of the importance of being ""born again "", understood as the witnessing of the faith through a range of evangelical activities, with a particular focus on Bible readings, literally interpreted. The purpose of this paper is to explore the evangelical world in general, and to analyze in particular the factors behind its growing dissemination and tremendous global success. Understanding the flexibility of the evangelical message and the ways in which it has adapted to different historical and geographical contexts is however pnly the first step in attempting to answer the question posed in the title of this article, namely whether or not the future of Christianity is evangelical. Yet the investigation proposed must be accompanied and indeed is driven by the methodological problem of whether the very definition of ""evangelical"" current today is excessively strained by its ascription to a remarkably broad, all-encompassing, and indeed ever expanding, movement.",,,,,,,,"Jenkins, P., (2007) The Next Christendom.

Our starting point is that, because of complex socio-economic interactions, environmental pressures, and fierce disputes, agriculture and rural development are today among the most controversial areas of policymaking, planning, and lobbying. With the encroachment of contemporary capitalism upon food production and biological systems, agriculture has become increasingly associated with, and subordinate to, a globalized agroindustrial complex that exerts decisive influence over technology, financing, logistics, and commercialization. In general terms, a-partial and problematic-transition from agriculture to agribusiness has taken place over the last century, with the last two decades or so seeing a further transition to neoliberalized agribusiness. Consequently, the concept of agribusiness, which was originally introduced in the 1950s at the time of Fordist agriculture in the USA, has had to mutate in order to encapsulate agricultural production based on business-friendly state interventions, policy liberalization, and the dominance of transnational corporations. © The Author(s) 2016.",,,,,,,,"Agyeman, J., Evans, B., ‘Just Sustainability’: The Emerging Discourse of Environmental Justice in Britain?

Informed by ethnographic research in Balochistan, Pakistan, this chapter delineates the relationship between homebirths and routine artificial labor induction to examine the consequences on Pakistani women’s health of normalizing the “un-enunciated experimental” off-label uses of misoprostol in nearly every case of childbirth, in homes and clinics, in the hopes of averting postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), whether or not the woman is at risk for it. The author argues that the rationale underlying the advocacy of misoprostol to presumably secure ‘global South’ women’s lives, even those not at risk of PPH, is an example of colonial governmentality. Moreover, normalizing misoprostol use in contexts of socio-structural inequalities, particularly where excessive artificial labor induction prevails, constitutes the enactment of a kind of “medical relativism.“In the guise of humanitarianism, the uterine-contracting misoprostol pill is increasingly viewed to be the best low-tech obstetric first-aid against maternal mortality, despite the evident risks of its use for women and the fetus. As such, the transnational off-label medical uses of this drug has effectively turned homebirths in “resource-poor” nations into unmarked and un-enunciated zones of experimentation, whereas the same drug is regarded too risky for similar uses, even in hospitals, in “resource-rich” nations. Misoprostol has become the public health solution in response to medico-humanitarian development discourses that construct homebirths as responsible for high maternal mortality. In the absence of proper safety tests, advocating its routine administration against postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in Pakistani homes serves to erase the distinction between service-delivery projects and experimentation. Drawing from ethnographic research in Balochistan, including Panjgur district and Quetta city, as well as Karachi and Islamabad in Pakistan, this chapter addresses the relationship between homebirths and routine labor induction in Pakistan to examine the implications on Pakistani women’s health of normalizing what I call the “un-enunciated experimental” off-label uses of misoprostol in nearly every case of childbirth, in homes and clinics, in the hopes of averting PPH, whether or not the woman is at risk for it. I suggest that the rationale underlying the advocacy of misoprostol to presumably secure ‘global South’ women’s lives, which may or may not be at risk of PPH, is an example of colonial governmentality. I argue that normalizing misoprostol use in contexts of socio-structural inequalities, particularly where excessive artificial labor induction prevails, constitutes the enactment of a kind of “medical relativism."" © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,,,,,,"Abou-Zhar, C., Wardlaw, T., Maternal mortality at the end of a decade: Signs of progress?

This literature review sought to provide contextual and historical reflection needed to bridge the conceptual gap between clinical efficacy and community effectiveness (i.e. knowledge and usage) of existing HIV prevention options, especially in resource-poor settings. Methods: Between January 2015 and October 2015, we reviewed scholarly and grey literatures to define treatment literacy and health literacy and assess the current need for literacy related to HIV prevention. The review included searches in electronic databases including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Permutations of the following search terms were used: ""treatment literacy,"" ""treatment education,"" ""health literacy,"" and ""prevention literacy."" Through an iterative process of analyses and searches, titles and/or abstracts and reference lists of retrieved articles were reviewed for additional articles, and historical content analyses of grey literature and websites were additionally conducted. Results and discussion: Treatment literacy was a well-established concept developed in the global South, which was later partially adopted by international agencies such as the World Health Organization. Treatment literacy emerged as more effective antiretroviral therapies became available. Developed from popular pedagogy and grassroots efforts during an intense struggle for treatment access, treatment literacy addressed the need to extend access to underserved communities and low-income settings that might otherwise be excluded from access. In contrast, prevention literacy is absent in the recent surge of new biomedical prevention strategies; prevention literacy was scarcely referenced and undertheorized in the available literature. Prevention efforts today include multimodal techniques, which jointly comprise a toolkit of biomedical, behavioural, and structural/environmental approaches. However, linkages to community advocacy and mobilization efforts are limited and unsustainable. Success of prevention efforts depends on equity of access, community-based ownership, and multilevel support structures to enable usage and sustainability. Conclusions: For existing HIV prevention efforts to be effective in ""real-world"" settings, with limited resources, reflection on historical lessons and contextual realities (i.e. policies, financial constraints, and biomedical patents) indicated the need to extend principles developed for treatment access and treatment literacy, to support prevention literacy and prevention access as an integral part of the global response to HIV. © 2016 Parker RG et al.","AIDS expertise; Health literacy; HIV prevention; HIV/AIDS; Prevention literacy; Treatment literacy","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiretroviral therapy; community care; health care access; health literacy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; lowest income group; medical information; organization and management; pedagogics; priority journal; Review; social environment; social evolution; systematic review; demography; HIV Infections; knowledge; literacy; psychology; HIV Infections; Humans; Knowledge; Literacy; Residence Characteristics",,,,,,"(2015) On the Fast-Track to end AIDS: World AIDS Day 2015 [Internet]., , http://www.unaids.org/wad2015/, UNAIDS.

In the context of its Urban Eye Health Programme in Bhopal (India), the organisation launched a pilot approach aimed at developing an Inclusive Eye Health (IEH) model and IEH Minimum Standards. Accessibility audits were conducted in a tertiary eye hospital and four primary vision centres located within urban slums, addressing the accessibility of physical infrastructures, communication and service provision. The collection and analysis of disaggregated data inform the inclusion strategy and provide a baseline to measure the impact of service provision. Trainings of eye health staff and sensitisation of decision makers on accessibility, Universal Design, disability and gender inclusion are organised on a regular basis. A referral network is being built to ensure participation of women, people with disabilities and other marginalised groups, explore barriers at demand level, and guarantee wider access to eye care in the community. Finally, advocacy interventions will be developed to raise awareness in the community and mainstream disability and gender inclusion within the public health sector. Founded on principles of Universal Design, accessibility and participation, and in line with international human rights treaties, Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Sightsavers' IEH model ultimately aims to develop a sustainable, scalable and universally accessible system-strengthening approach, capable of ensuring more inclusive services to people with disabilities, women and other marginalised groups, and designed to more effectively meet the health needs of the entire population. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.","Accessibility; Disability data disaggregation; Inclusive eye health","Decision making; Design; Housing; Laws and legislation; Accessibility; Data disaggregation; Eye health; People with disabilities; Referral networks; Service provisions; Universal access; Universal Design; Health; construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; eye disease; female; health care delivery; human; human rights; India; ophthalmology; poverty; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Eye Diseases; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Human Rights; Humans; India; Ophthalmology; Poverty Areas",,,,,,"(2011) World Report on Disability, , http://www.who.int/disabilities/world_report/2011/report.pdf, World Health Organization & World Bank .

RIP have only scarcely been addressed in detail from a human rights (HR) norm diffusion perspective, yet it is instructive for gaining further insights into norm dynamics, due to the marginalization of indigenous communities within their countries of origin as well as the concentration of indigenous populations in the Global South. RIP have hence been qualified as a ""least likely"" case for internationalization. Mainstream diffusion literature has mostly focused on the proliferation of liberal Western norms, radiating from ""the West"" to ""the Rest."" Powerful Western states as norm entrepreneurs have been explicitly included into models of normative change (for example, the spiral model). My qualitative process tracing research, however, presents a distinct pattern: Indigenous peoples themselves, in alliance with transnational advocacy networks and sympathetic states (to a considerable extent Latin American), have succeeded in constructing a new HR norm manifested in the UN Declaration on RIP. Among the skeptical norm takers were mainly liberal democracies such as the United States. To understand this puzzle, I combine Acharya's norm localization concept with its focus on ""cognitive priors"" with the norm appropriation framework recently suggested by Großklaus. © 2015 International Studies Association.",,"cognition; conceptual framework; democracy; globalization; human rights; indigenous population; liberalism; Latin America; United States",,,,,,"Acharya, A., How Ideas Spread: Whose Norms Matter?

It is a field of PR practice that generates high levels of both scholarly and public concern in regard to its perceived role in supporting corporate power and the associated impact on the functional legitimacy of democratic institutions. For this paper a content analysis was conducted of academic journals (between 2000 and 2013) to provide insights into how public affairs and lobbying have been theorised and researched within public relations scholarship and to ascertain to what degree wider public concerns have been addressed. Findings include an empirical confirmation of the low level of research activity on public affairs; that stakeholder and rhetorical theories have been the most widely used theories, but are far from constituting dominant paradigms; that scholarship has privileged functional objectives over civic concerns; and that published work originates almost entirely from institutions in Europe and the US with the Global South invisible. The paper also discusses future directions for research in public affairs and advocates the placing of discourse into definitions of public affairs, and that academic public relations should assert responsibility for this field, but in a manner that more equitably balances organisational and societal concerns. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Campaigns; Discourse; Lobbying; Public affairs; Public relations theory; Relationships",,,,,,,"An, S., Cheng, I., Crisis communication research in Public Relations Journals: Tracking (2010) The handbook of crisis communication, , Coombs Holladay Wiley-Blackwell Chichester; Baumgartner, F.R., Berry, M., Hojnacki, M., Leech, B., Kimball, D., Lobbying and policy change: Who wins, who loses, and why (2009), University of Chicago Press Chicago; Baumgartner, F., Leech, B., Basic interests: The importance of groups in politics and in political science (1998), Princeton University Press Princeton, NJ; Beder, S., Global spin: The corporate assault on environmentalism (2002), 2nd ed.

Advocating “special caution and sensitivity,” he calls for “relative universality.” Other scholars advocate similar views. At the same time Donnelly agrees with the new anthropological insight about the “deeply contested” nature of cultures in the global South, as elsewhere, that in my view makes the recognition of the cultural differences across North-South axis almost impossible. How could Western advocates decide which of the fractions in a given contested culture should be nominated for culturally-sensitive considerations to arrive at “relative universality?” A significant section of his theory explains how universalism can be relativized in “interpretation” and “implementation.” I contend that scholars, exploring the notion of “tempered” universality, should focus on the violating nation-states and posit their theories on the corpus of the available documentations and analyses. Hypothetical examples without references to specific human rights reports cannot be practically useful for monitoring and advocacy. © 2015 by Johns Hopkins University Press.",,"advocacy; cultural influence; human rights; theory; Western world",,,,,,"Donnelly, J., The Relative Universality of Human Rights (2007) Hum.

It was rather an indication of the pragmatic attitudes that prevailed among the educated bureaucratic circles. It had no epistemological affinity with anything like comprehensive moral doctrine reaching a consensus on the notion of justice. The non-Westerners were the representatives of the political elites who were earnestly erecting their palatial columns on societal landscapes whose religious traditions were still largely intact. Who among them could, with any degree of sincerity or credibility, engage in articulating a theory and showing the existing global “civilizations” arriving at a consensus based on “political conceptions of justice”? Populism driven by religions had yet to intrude into the politics of the newly imagined nation-states; Muslim scholar Tariq Ramadan disparages both Ataturk and Bourguiba. The Tunisian “regime was a dictatorship, one that used religious symbols to ensure a certain level of legitimacy, but whose actions militated against religious expression….

He writes, “For some time until the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, figh functioned effectively.” Then, “certain events coinciding with the emergence of modernity disrupted its continuity.” He adds: “The juggernaut of modernity also dramatically influenced the cumulative social, cultural, and economic system of the Muslim people….

In the summary statement in the 2012 report, The Special Rapporteur wrote, Despite there being much to commend about the United States of America’s record on extrajudicial killings, three areas where significant improvement remains necessary were identified in the mission report (A/HRC/11/2/Add.5). These areas concern due process in the imposition of the death penalty; transparency in law enforcement, military and intelligence operations; and accountability for potentially unlawful deaths in the Government’s international operations.

This special issue presents a collection of carefully selected papers to counter-balance the skewed tendency observed in current urban China studies. We argue that the growth and spatiality of China’s new urbanism can be better understood by a critical analysis of how the state, market, and society interact in the processes of producing and consuming urban spaces in a rapidly changing global and local context. We propose that contemporary Chinese urban processes and experiences can be demonstrated holistically and realistically by placing due attention on both the production and consumption of China’s new urban spaces and the resulting contestations and contradictions. Our collective effort to examine how China’s state–market–society triad plays out in the production and consumption of urban spaces has yielded significant insights to advance ongoing enquiry in urbanising China in response to the advocacy for a decentring theorisation of the urban revolutions taking a perspective inclusive of the voices from the global south. © 2015, © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2015.","China; ground-up approach; political economy; state–market–society relation; urban revolution; urbanism","global perspective; literature review; market conditions; skewness; theoretical study; urban area; urban economy; urbanization; China",,,,,"NSFC: 41271147, 41271180, 41322003; RGC, UGC: GRF 746413H","Anagnost, A., (1997) National Past-times: Narrative, Representation, and Power in Modern China, , Durham: Duke University Press; Anagnost, A., The corporeal politics of quality (suzhi) (2004) Public Culture, 16 (2), pp. 189-208; Bian, Y.J., Logan, J., Market transition and the persistence of power: The changing stratification system in urban China (1996) American Sociological Review, 61, pp. 739-758; Bray, D., Building ‘community’: New strategies of governance in urban China (2006) Economy and Society, 35 (4), pp. 530-549; Brenner, N., Schmid, C., Planetary urbanization (2012) Urban Constellations, pp. 10-13. , Gandy M., (ed), Berlin: Jovis,,.

However, little attention has been paid to the responses of local employers to the emergence of labor organizations in their factories, partly as a result of these campaigns. This article, based on a two-year fieldwork project in the Guatemalan apparel sector, shows how the local managers of this industry manage to reconcile the demands of brands with the continuation of repressive labor control in the workplace by means of ""concealed repression""; namely, preventive strategies, subtle antiunion discrimination, ""opportune inaction,"" and deliberate illicit transactions involving state officials. © 2015 Mobilization: An International Quarterly.",,,,,,,,"Anner, M., Corporate Social Responsibility and Freedom of Association Rights: The Precarious Quest for Legitimacy and Control in Global Supply Chains (2012) Politics & Society, 40 (4), pp. 604-639; Anner, M., Two Logics of Labor Organizing in the Global Apparel Industry (2009) International Studies Quarterly, 53 (3), pp. 545-570; Anner, M., Forging New Labor Activism in Global Commodity Chains in Latin America (2007) International Labor and Working-Class History, 72 (1), pp. 18-41; Armbruster-Sandoval, R., (2005) Globalization and Cross-Border Labor Solidarity in the Americas: The Anti-Sweatshop Movement and the Struggle for Social Justice, , New York: Routledge; Javier, A., (2007) Routine Politics and Violence in Argentina: The Gray Zone of State Power, , New York: Cambridge; Auyero, J., Malher, M., Relations occultes et fondements de la violence collective (2011) Politix, 93 (1), pp. 115-139; (1994) El Significado de La Maquila en Guatemala.

More specifically it holds that the practice of mediation, the third party representation of citizens to states and vice versa, is a widespread and important political practice in this context. Largely distinct from the contentious politics and popular mobilisation of social movements, mediation is more a politics of negotiation and bargaining by representatives. Developed as an emergent analysis from multiple case studies, mediation is a broad concept that includes practices that at other times might be described as lobbying, clientelism and coercion, but that we conceptualise in terms of claiming legitimacy to speak for the poor and marginalised, and theorise in terms of a democratic deficit between formal political institutions and these groups. In addition to identifying different kinds of mediators, the article categorises mediation in terms of the orientation and nature of various mediatory practices. Lastly, the article identifies at least three explanations for mediation including the endurance of pre-democratic political relations and practices, new forms of social exclusion in post-colonial democracies and the erosion of state authority brought about by neo-liberal policies and globalisation. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","citizenship; clientelism; democratic deficit; representation; state–society relations","citizenship; democracy; globalization; party politics; political relations; state-local relations",,,,,,"Ankersmit, F., (1997) Aesthetic Politics: Political Philosophy Beyond Fact and Value, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Avritzer, L., (2002) Democracy and the Public Space in Latin America, , Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Baiocchi, G., Heller, P., Silva, M., (2011) Bootstrapping Democracy: Transforming Local Governance and Civil Society in Brazil, , Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press; Bayat, A., From ‘Dangerous Classes’ to ‘Quiet Rebels’: Politics of the Urban Subaltern in the Global South (2000) International Sociology, 15 (3), pp. 533-557; Beer, J., Packard, C.C., Stief, E., (2012) The Mediator's Handbook: Revised & Expanded, , 4th ed., Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers; Bel, B., (2012) Media and Mediation, , London: Sage; Calleros-Alarcon, J.C., (2008) The Unfinished Transition to Democracy in Latin America, , London: Routledge; Chatterjee, P., (2004) The Politics of the Governed: Popular Politics in Most of the World, , New York: Columbia; Chopra, D., Mediation India's Policy Spaces, Ch6 (2014) Mediated Citizenship: The Informal Politics of Speaking for Citizens in the Global South, , Von Lieres B., Piper L., (eds), Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan; Coelho, V.S., Von Lieres, B., (2010) Mobilising for Democracy: Citizen Action and the Politics of Public Participation, , London: Zed; Cornwall, A., Coelho, V.S., Spaces for Change?

A mosaic of divergent reciprocations in resource relations were noticed due to livelihood transitions in the rural areas where previous resource uses and relations had been primarily within agriculture. The reconstitution of rural spaces and the attendant changes in the resource equations are observed to be creating new sites of conformity, contestation and conflicts that often move beyond local spaces. This paper critically reviews studies across the Global South to explore the nature and extent of changes in resource relations and agricultural landscapes post livelihood diversification and the implication and challenges of these changes for natural resource governance. Though there is drastic reduction in agricultural livelihoods throughout the Global South, changes in agricultural area are found to be inconsistent and heterogeneous in the region. Agriculture continues in the countrysides but in widely differentiated capacities and redefined value systems. The transformed agrarian spaces are characterized by a mosaic of scenarios from persistence and sustainable subsistence to differentiation and exploitative commercial practices to abandonment and speculation. The reconfigured resource relations, emergent multiple and multi-scalar interest groups, institutional and policy changes and altered power differentials in these diversified landscapes are yet to be incorporated into natural resource governance frameworks such as IRBM. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agricultural landscape; Diversification; Governance; Livelihoods; Natural resources; River basin management","agrarian change; agricultural land; basin management; developing world; land use change; natural resource; policy making; resource management; river basin; rural development; rural landscape; rural policy; rural society; Southern Hemisphere; agricultural land; agricultural worker; agriculture; feminization; landscape; mosaicism; Review; river basin; rural area; agriculture; environmental protection; forest; government; human; natural resource; procedures; river; rural population; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forests; Government; Humans; Natural Resources; Rivers; Rural Population",,,,,"NIAS","Adger, W.N., Brown, K., Tompkins, E.L., The political economy of cross-scale networks in resource co-management (2005) Ecol.

Extensive research has been conducted on urban agriculture policies in the global South, but much less is known about associated practices and policies in the global North. This is especially true for the Canadian context and therefore the present study aims at improving our overall understanding of the urban agriculture situation in two Canadian provinces. Relevant policies, such as official plans or official community plans, alternate policy documents and guidelines, zoning by-laws, and animal-related by-laws were reviewed for 10 municipalities in Ontario and in British Columbia, all varying in socio-economic and climatological characteristics. Additional key informant interviews were conducted with municipal planners, community garden coordinators, and other municipal staff familiar with urban agriculture policies from six of the selected municipalities.In line with global trends, our results suggest that urban agriculture is becoming more widespread in the two provinces. However, even though all studied municipalities consistently support urban agriculture, they vary significantly in their approach, with some municipalities focusing much more narrowly on certain types of activities than others. Overall, community advocacy and municipal council support are the most important drivers in the policy process. Key informants expressed a need to bridge existing gaps between policy adoption and implementation of tools, emphasize public education and public awareness, create inventories of land available for urban agriculture, incorporate urban agriculture in the development review process, and focus on the commercial potential of the practice. Encouragingly, despite the many challenges that need to be addressed, we found that many opportunities exist that municipalities could consider when creating improved local urban agriculture policies and tools to enhance the urban food system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","British Columbia; Food system; Municipal policy; Ontario; Urban agriculture; Urban planning","agricultural policy; crop; livestock; policy implementation; urban area; urban planning; British Columbia; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Animalia",,,,,,"Adin, E.K., Kurnicki, A.F., Urban farms in Canada (2014) Plan Canada, 54 (1), pp. 10-15; Black, R.E., Taking space to grow food and community: urban agriculture and guerrilla gardening in Vancouver (2013) Cuizine: J.

Wavering between participatory and advocacy research, we explore how we grapple with finding the right audience with whom to share results, our attempts to craft communication to be relevant within specific contexts, and dilemmas over self-censorship. We also document our struggles to manage our own expectations and those of the communities with whom we work regarding the ability of our research to broker change. This article emerged from our frustration at wanting to be accountable to our interviewee communities, but finding few academic articles that go beyond ideals to examine how researchers often struggle to meet these expectations. While participatory approaches are increasingly mainstreamed in social science work, we argue that advocacy research can be a more appropriate response to community needs in certain cases. © 2015, SAGE Publications.

Yet the practical challenges and opportunities involved in crossing sub-disciplinary boundaries, particularly at postgraduate level, are rarely examined. The processes which together shape various stages of postgraduate training and research are reflected on here. Through addressing approaches to research on the global South, specifically in the case of India's pharmaceutical industry, it is shown how in-depth fieldwork, including engagement with the empirical realities of stakeholder interviews, can make sub-disciplinary boundary crossing a necessity. Opportunities arise for postgraduate students to produce research that cuts across the more established academic boundaries and that may ultimately result in richer geographies of development. © 2014 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Development geography; Economic geography; Fieldwork; India; Methodology; Postgraduate",,,,,,,"Barnes, T., Lives lived and lives told: biographies of geography's quantitative revolution (2001) Environment and Planning D: Society and Space, 19, pp. 409-429; Barnes, T., Sheppard, E., 'Nothing includes everything': towards engaged pluralism in Anglophone economic geography (2010) Progress in Human Geography, 34, pp. 193-214; Bauder, H., Learning to become a geographer: reproduction and transformation in academia (2006) Antipode, 38, pp. 671-679; Bebbington, A., Global networks and local developments: agendas for development geography (2003) Tijdschrift voor economische en sociale geografie, 94, pp. 297-309; Bebbington, A., Kothari, U., Transnational development networks (2006) Environment and Planning A, 38, pp. 849-866; Binns, T., Marginal lands, marginal geographies (2007) Progress in Human Geography, 31, pp. 587-591; Butz, D., Besio, K., Autoethnography (2009) Geography Compass, 3, pp. 1660-1674; Chacko, E., Positionality and praxis: fieldwork experiences in rural India (2004) Singapore Journal of Tropical Geography, 25, pp. 51-63; Desai, V., Potter, R., (2006) Doing development research, , eds, Sage, London; Dicken, P., Geographers and 'globalization': (yet) another missed boat?

The aftermath of Peru's internal conflict as well as other Latin American cases are discussed to examine the possible connections between the social conditions of victims and the effectiveness of the investigative efforts. At present, global politics of memory are not as inclusive as they should to attain true guarantees of nonrepetition. In many countries of the Global South there are no national search strategies or revised public policies for the search of missing persons, and in many places the families of the victims, victims themselves, are not acknowledged stakeholders with a voice, and are simply neglected in investigations, which often focus in prosecutions and much less so in victim identification or restoration. Forensic investigators need to gather as much antemortem and postmortem data as possible to fully understand the roles of both perpetrators and victims at the time of the events, and, in certain contexts, to do so, they face the need to develop multitasking skills. More applicable scientific standards and emic categories that both investigators and victims can understand should be developed. Forensic investigators can contribute substantially to advocacy supporting human rights against impunity and exclusion, transcending the strict scientific sphere. © 2014 by the American Anthropological Association.","Forensic sciences; Missing persons; Reconciliation; The Global South; Transactions of memory",,,,,,,"Baraybar, J.P., When DNA Is Not Available, Can We Still Identify People?

While formal urban governance is geared toward transforming Delhi into a ""world-class"" city, I present original research that shows how the everyday governance of urban space in three very different areas of Delhi is determined by relations among non-state actors. These regimes foster access to space for street hawkers on an everyday basis while they allow powerful local interest groups to collect rent and influence flows of people and commodities. I argue that, in contrast to formal electoral politics, these governance regimes emerge from a parallel politics of everyday interactions, negotiations, and transgressions. Although the emancipatory potential of these regimes should not be overstated, they do offer street hawkers limited contingency to improve their access to urban space. This article contributes to a growing body of work on urban governance by showing how multiplicities of governance regimes coexist and determine how and by whom urban space is used in a metropolis in the global South. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.","Delhi; global South; informal economy; urban governance","electoral system; governance approach; metropolitan area; urban economy; urban policy; Delhi; India; New Delhi",,,,,"NSF: BCS-1103027","Wacquar, A., Kundu, A., Peet R, (2011) India's New Economic Policy: Acritical Analysis, , New York, NY: Routledge; Aijaz, R., Form of urban and local government in India (2008) Journal of Asian and AfricanStudies, 43 (2), pp. 131-154; Allen, J., Cochrane, A., Assemblages of state power: Topological shifts in theorganization of government and politics (2010) Antipode, 42 (5), pp. 1071-1089; Anjaria, J.S., Street hawkers and public space in Mumbai (2006) Economic AndPolitical Weekly, 41 (21), pp. 2140-2146; Anjaria, J.S., Guardians of the bourgeois city: Citizenship, public space, andmiddle-class activism in Mumbai (2009) City & Community, 8 (4), pp. 391-406; Anjaria, J.S., Ordinary states: Everyday corruption and the politics of space inMumbai (2011) American Ethnologist, 38 (1), pp. 58-72; Appadurai, A., Deep democracy: Urban governmentality and the horizon of politics (2002) Public Culture, 14 (1), pp. 21-47; Arabindoo, P., City of sand"": Stately re-imagination of Marina beach in Chennai (2011) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 35 (2), pp. 379-401; Bandyopadhyay, R., Politics of archiving: Hawkers and pavement dwellers in Calcutta (2011) Dialectical Anthropology, 35 (3), pp. 295-316; Banerjee-Guha S, (2010) Accumulation by Dispossession: Transformative Cities in Thenew Global Order, , New York, NY: Sage; Bayat, A., From dangerous classes to ""quiet rebels"": Politics of the urban subaltern inthe global south (2000) International Sociology, 15 (3), pp. 533-567; Benjamin, S., Governance, economic settings and poverty in Bangalore (2000) Environmentand Urbanization, 12 (1), pp. 35-56; Benjamin, S., Occupancy urbanism: Radicalizing politics and economy beyond policyand programs (2008) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 32 (3), pp. 719-729; Brenner N, (2004) New State Spaces: Urban Governance and the Rescaling of Statehood, , Oxford:Oxford, University Press; Brenner, N., What is critical urban theory?

The production, circulation, use and evaluation of empirical scientific 'evidence' played a central part in activists' engagement with AIDS science. Previous activist engagement with evidence focused on the social and biomedical responses to HIV in the global North as well as challenges around ensuring antiretroviral treatment (ART) was available in the global South. More recently, however, with the roll-out and scale-up of large public-sector ART programmes and new multi-dimensional prevention efforts, the relationships between evidence and activism have been changing. Scale-up of these large-scale treatment and prevention programmes represents an exciting new opportunity while bringing with it a host of new challenges. This paper examines what new forms of evidence and activism will be required to address the challenges of the scaling-up era of HIV treatment and prevention. It reviews some recent controversies around evidence and HIV scale-up and describes the different forms of evidence and activist strategies that will be necessary for a robust response to these new challenges. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","activism; antiretroviral treatment (ART); evidence; health policy; HIV/AIDS","Anti-Retroviral Agents; Capacity Building; HIV Infections; Humans; International Cooperation; Patient Advocacy; Politics; Public Health; World Health",,,,,"NIH; NICHD: R24HD077976","Abdool Karim, Q., Abdool Karim, S.S., Frohlich, J.A., Grobler, A.C., Baxter, C., Mansoor, L.E., Taylor, D., Effectiveness and safety of tenofovir gel, an antiretroviral microbicide, for the prevention of HIV infection in women (2010) Science, 329, pp. 1168-1174; (2010) A cascade of hope and questions: Understanding the results of CAPRISA 004, , AVAC: Global Advocacy for HIV Prevention, New York, NY,: Author; Baral, S., Phaswana-Mafuya, N., Rewriting the narrative of the epidemiology of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (2012) SAHARA-J: Journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS, 9 (3), pp. 127-130; Boulle, A., Clayden, P., Cohen, K., Cohen, T., Conradie, F., Dong, K., Wilson, D., Prolonged deferral of antiretroviral therapy in the SAPIT trial: Did we need a clinical trial to tell us that this would increase mortality?

A succession of neoliberal policy initiatives and bureaucratic reforms over the last 30 years have shifted responsibility for the provision of social services for the poor from the state onto local nonprofit agencies, communities, and ultimately individuals. As welfare state programs have been dismantled, privatized, or come under increasing austerity pressures, nonprofits have become the principal providers of assistance to people in economic need. Immigrants, for whom federally funded programs have historically been scarce and lacked broad political support, are particularly likely to access services and programming through the voluntary sector. New immigrants, who disproportionally come from the Global South, have considerable needs as they settle into their new place of residence. Those whose skills are limited and systematically devalued in the post-industrial economy often require assistance with employment placement, addressing legal issues, securing affordable housing and engaging in the many everyday activities that sustain life in a new place and create a sense of belonging. Migrant civil society organizations-community groups, faith-based organizations, nonprofits, and unions that provide services to, and in conjunction with, migrants-have become key players in shaping the integration of migrants into an increasingly polarized and spatially differentiated society. Yet, the lack of systematic public programs to assist immigrants in the United States and the growing reliance on nonprofits to address their multiple needs raise concerns regarding the ability of the current system to serve all immigrants equally and foster their integration into local economies and societies. In particular, recent research draws attention to the contradictory role of migrant nonprofit and voluntary organizations as they occupy a unique space at the intersection of the state and civil society. In this chapter we focus on the tensions that civil society organizations face in serving immigrant needs. We begin by contextualizing the emergence of these organizations as key providers of services and advocacy work within two related trends: the globalization and marginalization of labor, and the introduction of neoliberal state reforms since the 1980s. We then provide an overview of the programs and strategies supported by the voluntary sector, paying particular attention to the relationship between nonprofit organizations and the state and emphasizing the geographic implications of a U.S. immigration system that depends heavily on migrant civil society. We end with a discussion of the impact of the re-scaling of immigrant assistance on communities and citizenship. © 2015 Stephen Nathan Haymes, María Vidal de Haymes, and Reuben Jonathan Miller.",,,,,,,,"Bloemraad, I., (2006) Becoming a citizen: Incorporating immigrants and refugees in the United States and Canada, , Berkeley, CA: University of California Press; Cloke, P., Johnsen, S., May, J., Ethical citizenship?

Our current path is leaving many behind, destroying the environment and entrenching inequality and systemic poverty. This introduction sets the scene to Rethinking Food Systems and provides an account of the legal and rights-based approaches taken throughout the book. It also begins a discussion on the benefits and limitations to using the law to address hunger and malnutrition. Further, by examining the arguments of the contributing authors and the crosscutting themes in their chapters, this introduction begins to explore the following questions: What are just, sustainable, and equitable food systems? What are the values on which they are built? What tools are available to push for change? What are the advantages and disadvantages of rights-based approaches? Should actors focus on the sub-national, national, regional or global level in their advocacy efforts? And should these actors push for new laws, focus instead on policies and programmes, or put efforts into developing alternative practices? How should they approach the challenge of large-scale land acquisitions in the Global South, intellectual property regimes imposed from above or the growing fragmentation in the international management of food systems? What is and what should be the role of the state in addressing issues of hunger and food insecurity and what role do and should international institutions, consumers and producers play?. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014.","Economic and social rights; Food sovereignty; Human rights; Justiciability; Peasant movements; Respect, protect and fulfill; Right to food; State obligations; Trade; Via campesina",,,,,,,"(2009) THe STate of FOod INsecurity in the WOrld 4, , The FAO estimated that close to 1 billion people, or 1/6th of humanity, were hungry and undernourished in 2009.Id; Eric, E., Holt-Gimenez, R., Patelshattuck, A., Food Rebellions!

After noting significant developments around the world, the article focuses on three countries of the Global South, showing a trend toward more social activism and fewer statements.

It asks how these intersections are formed, negotiated and resisted across time and places, including the UK, Europe, North America, Australia, and the Global South. Questions around ‘queer’ engagements in same-sex marriages, civil partnerships and other practices (e.g. adoption) have created a number of provoking stances and policy provisions - but what remains unanswered is how people experience and situate themselves within sometimes competing, or ‘contradictory’, moments as ‘religious queers’ who may be tasked with ‘queering religion’. Additionally, the presumed paradoxes of ‘marriage’, queer sexuality, religion and youth combine to generate a noteworthy generational absence. This leads to questions about where ‘religious queers’ reside, resist and relate experiences of intersecting religious and sexual lives.In looking at interconnectedness, this collection offers international contributions which bridge the ‘contradictions’ in queering religion and in making visible ‘religious queers.’ It provides insight into older and younger people’s understandings of religiosity, queer cultures, and religious groups. A small but active religious minority in the US has received much attention for its anti-gay political activity; much less attention has been paid to the more positive, supportive role that religious-based groups play in e.g. providing housing, education and political advocacy for queer youth. Queer methodologies and intersectional approaches offer a lens both theoretically and methodologically to uncover the salience of related social divisions and identities. This collection is both innovative and sensitive to ‘blended’ identities and their various enactments. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

As the movement expands into the Global South, it actively pressures local grassroots associations to adopt a new organizational model in order to become membership-based advocacy organizations. Many groups, however, are embedded in local civic environments that expect them to act as self-help and social support organizations. As such, grassroots associations are caught between two organizational environments, each promoting different models and practices.Design/methodology/approach - This analysis draws upon 18 months of participant observation and 69 interviews gathered from a local coalition of seven grassroots disability associations in Nicaragua. This ethnographic approach is combined with sociological institutionalism, an analysis that emphasizes the way organizations conform to organizational models that spread across a field.Findings - The local associations responded in a variety of ways to the advocacy model promoted by the international movement. Organizations either conformed, resisted, or developed hybrid organizational models on the basis of internal characteristics that determined how they straddled the two organizational environments.Originality/value - This paper highlights the way international models may be ineffective in local environments that have civic traditions and lower levels of governmental capacity than found in the West. Some disability associations, however, will creatively combine local and international models to create new initiatives that make a positive impact in the lives of persons with disabilities at the grassroots.

Th is article analyzes several factors that are now challenging this equilibrium, e.g., these days the largest international groups are placing more of their staffoutside the West, and the people conducting research and advocacy for international organizations are increasingly from the global South. Tensions between international and national groups occur primarily in relation to media attention and fundraising. Yet, there are ways to strength partnerships between national and international organizations, such as by active strategizing together, sharing information and resources that may more readily be available to international groups, establishing staffexchange programs, sharing donor prospects and fundraising leads, and speaking and publishing jointly, and assisting each other with the promotion of work through tools like social media.","Global south; Human rights watch; International organizations; Partnership",,,,,,,,,,"Sur - Rede Universitaria de Direitos Humanos",,,,,18066445,,,,"English","Sur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84910665878

This paper explores how the availability of foreign funding affects their downward accountability, abilities to effect social change, and their relative influence in relation to traditional grassroots, membership-based organizations (GROs), which tend not to receive such funding. Drawing on a case study of Nicaragua, we challenge the notion that foreign funding of domestic NGOs leads to the evolution of civil society organizations, which have incentives and abilities to organize the marginalized sections of society in ways to effect social change in their interests. Instead, we find that foreign funding and corresponding professionalization of the NGO sector creates dualism among domestic civil society organizations. Foreign funding enhances the visibility and prestige of the ""modern"" NGO sector over traditional GROs. This has grave policy implications because foreign-funded NGOs tend to be more accountable to donors than beneficiaries and are more focused on service delivery than social change-oriented advocacy. © 2013 International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Accountability; Central America; Civil society; Foreign funding; NGOs; Nicaragua","accountability; advocacy; civil society; grassroots level; nongovernmental organization; social change; social organization; Nicaragua",,,,,,"AbouAssi, K., Hands in the pockets of mercurial donors: NGO response to shifting funding priorities (2012) Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, , doi: 10. 1177/0899764012439629; Arellano-López, S., Petras, J.F., Non-governmental organizations and poverty alleviation in Bolivia (1994) Development and Change, 25, pp. 558-568; Barraclough, S.L., (1988) Aid that Counts: The Western Contribution to Development and Survival in Nicaragua, , Transnational Institute, Birmingham: Transnational Institute; Bartley, T., How foundations shape social movements (2007) Social Problems, 54 (3), pp. 229-255; Baumeister, E., Farmer's organizations and agrarian transformation in Nicaragua (1995) The New Politics of Survival: Grassroots Movements in Central America, pp. 238-263. , M.

Emancipation from bondage is the conceptual and moral imperative that undergirds IJM's mission, along with many other anti-trafficking organizations that, like IJM, imagine themselves as new abolitionists fighting trafficking as a modern-day form of slavery. By drawing on commonly held assumptions about the nature of slavery and freedom, IJM offers a problematic vision of what the liberated subject of rescue should look like: a non-white woman who literally moves from darkness to light because she has been rescued by IJM. This vision of emancipation enables IJM to enact a particular set of strategies and programmes that are carceral and coercive (such as indefinite holding in government remand homes) in the name of saving victims of trafficking. By way of contrast, the essay examines the programming and mission of SANGRAM-VAMP, a non-profit advocacy organization and sex workers' union in Maharashtra, India. By analysing the various conflicts members of SANGRAM-VAMP have experienced with the IJM field office in Maharashtra, this essay concludes by describing a transformation of the ground on which anti-trafficking initiatives could potentially base the project of doing justice. In placing the radically different politics of SANGRAM-VAMP and IJM in tension, the essay asks whether a counter-discourse is possible by reimagining emancipation as a project that foregrounds collaborative processes of action that are decoupled from the action of a single emancipator. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,,,,"Agust́n, L.M., Sex at the margins: Migration (2007) Labour Markets and the Rescue Industry, , New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Berman, J., The left, the right, and the prostitute: The making of US antitrafficking in persons policy (2006) Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law, 14, pp. 269-293; Bernstein, E., The sexual politics of the new abolitionism (2007) Differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, 18 (3), pp. 128-151; Bernstein, E., Militarized humanitarianism meets carceral feminism: The politics of sex, rights, and freedom in contemporary antitrafficking campaigns (2010) Signs, 36 (1), pp. 45-71; Brace, L., (2004) The Politics of Property: Labour, Freedom, and Belonging, , Edinburgh: University of Edinburgh Press; Brion Davis, D., (1984) Slavery and Human Progress, , New York: Oxford University Press; Capous Desyllas, M., A critique of global trafficking discourse and US policy (2007) Journal of Sociology and Social Welfare, 34 (4), pp. 57-79; Chapkis, W., Trafficking, migration, and the law: Protecting innocents, punishing immigrants (2003) Gender and Society, 17 (6), pp. 923-937; Chapkis, W., Soft glove, punishing fist: The Trafficking victims protection act of 2000 (2005) Regulating Sex: The Politics of Intimacy and Identity, pp. 51-67. , in Elizabeth Bernstein and Laurie Schaffner (eds), New York: Routledge; Cheng, S., Muckraking and stories untold: Ethnography meets journalism on trafficked women and the US military (2008) Sexuality Research and Social Policy, 5 (4), pp. 6-18; Cheng, S., (2010) On the Move for Love: Migrant Entertainers and the US Military in South Korea, , Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press; Doezema, J., Loose women or lost women?

They demanded that Russell reopen a plant in Honduras that had closed in response to a union drive, firing 1, 200 workers. At the National Basketball Association (NBA) finals in Florida and Los Angeles, students denounced the NBA for its licensing agreement with Russell. At sporting goods stores, they called for a boycott against Russell. In Omaha, Nebraska, they protested at investor Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway head office, criticizing Berkshire’s ownership of Russell’s parent firm. Sixty-five US Congressional leaders signed a letter highlighting their ‘grave concern’ at reports of ‘severe violations’ of labour rights at Russell. The universities of Michigan, Stanford, Harvard, Cornell and some hundred others suspended millions of dollars worth of their purchases of Russell Athletic apparel. Faced with this multifaceted, sophisticated and well-organized campaign, Russell Athletic capitulated and agreed to reopen the Honduran plant, hire back the dismissed workers, recognize and bargain with the union, and not interfere with union drives at its other plants in Honduras (Greenhouse 2009; USAS 2009). It was an extraordinary victory at a time when most labour movements, not least in the United States, had been in massive retreat. Behind this victory was an extraordinary organization: the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC), an independent labour advocacy and monitoring organization in the United States. The WRC began the campaign with its authoritative investigative report on the Russell plant’s closing. As the institutional heart of the anti-sweatshop movement in North America, the WRC promotes labour rights and standards in the global clothing industry, particularly in the global South where labour rights and standards are few and/or rarely enforced. The WRC focuses particularly on US collegiate apparel, a sector with an estimated three to four billion dollars in annual revenue. Created in 2000 by the student anti-sweatshop movement, United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS), the WRC eschews all corporate affiliation. It is internationalist in orientation, largely transnational, and North-South in practice. © 2012 United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD).",,,,,,,,"Appelbaum, R., (2005) TNCs and the Removal of Textiles and Clothing Quotas, , http://repositories.cdlib.org/isber/cgs/3/, Geneva: UNCTAD.

On the one hand, gender inequalities can determine who owns or controls housing, the degree of investment made in dwelling materials and infrastructure, how domestic spaces are used, and who spends most time dealing with shelter inadequacies on a daily basis. On the other hand, several aspects of housing, such as tenure, quality, location, accessibility, and service provision, can have major impacts on gender divisions of labour, resources, power, and rights. These inequalities disproportionately affect women and are often at their most marked in the context of urban slums in developing countries. As such there is an urgent need for attention from organisations and interest groups concerned with the reduction of poverty and gender injustice. © 2012 Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved..","'Urban penalty' in health; Assets; Gender; Health; HIV/AIDS; Housing; Migration; Millennium development goals; Poverty; Sex ratios; Slums; Statistics; Women",,,,,,,"Ambert, C., Jassey, K., Thomas, L., HIV, AIDS and urban development issues in sub-Saharan Africa (2007) Beyond Sex and Medicines: Why Getting the Basics Right is Part of the Response!

A particularly prominent example is the antisweatshopmovement, a diverse collection of efforts to promote labor rights and improve working conditions in international supply chains for apparel and footwear products. Much of the literature on the antisweatshop movement emphasizes its global nature and the reliance of activists on transnational advocacy networks involving coalitions of Northern (usually U.S.-based) consumers and Southern workers. Drawing theoretical inspiration from the varieties of capitalism literature, we examine instead the emergence and institutionalization of antisweatshop politics within the global North. Based on interviews with groups in eight countries, we analyze the trajectories of antisweatshop activism in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada, finding marked variation in the leadership and composition of the movement across regions. Antisweatshop politics were particularly contentious in the United States, where labor leaders were active in framing the sweatshop scourge as a domestic as well as an international social problem. In Europe and Canada, the key role was played not by organized labor, but by other civil society groups that encouraged a multistakeholder approach to what was perceived primarily as an issue of social and economic development in the global South. Overall, our analysis highlights how national institutions and political cultures shape the way that actors assess a social problem and evaluate the possibilities available to effect meaningful change.

Sources of information are similarly criticised, often for being inaccessible or displaying unethical behaviour, ranging from hyperbole to the more serious distortion or omission of factual information. This article explores the Climate Change Media Partnership's 2011 policy guidelines for policymakers in the global South, and volunteers some thoughts in the context of the 'problem of knowledge' (Baggini 2002). It looks at the challenges faced by South African journalists, asking whether 'caring' necessitates advocacy in environmental journalism. The article concludes by examining Claassen's (n.d.) ethical beacons for science journalists, and suggesting a preliminary ethical framework for South African environmental journalists. © 2012 iMasa.","Environmental journalism; Ethical beacons; Ethical framework; Policy guidelines",,,,,,,"Archibald, E., Problems with environmental reporting: Perspectives of daily newspaper reporters (1999) Journal of Environmental Education, 99 (30), pp. 27-73. , (Summer); Baggini, J., (2002) Making sense: Philosophy behind the headlines., , Oxford: BCA/Oxford University Press; (2009) BBC World Service Trust Public Briefing No. 3., , BBC World Service Trust, October; Berglez, P., Inside, outside and beyond media logic: Journalistic creativity in climate change (2011) Media, Culture & Society, 33 (3), pp. 449-465; Chrunik, E., (2008) Does 'caring' require advocacy in journalism?, , http://www.joumalismethics.info/feature_articles/does_caring_require_advocacy.html, (accessed 12 August 2011); Claasen, G., (2011) Ethics in science journalism, , http://www.frayintermedia.com/download/sci_conf/The%20ethics%20in%20science%20joumalism%20-%20claassen.pdf, accessed 8 August; Cohn, V., Cope, L., (2001) News and numbers-a guide to reporting statistical claims and controversies in health and other fields., , Iowa: Blackwell Publishing; Cornell, J., (2009) Advocates, adversaries, and adjuncts: The ethics of international science journalism from a US perspective, , http://www.int-res.eom/articles/esep2009/9/joumalism/e009pp4.pdf, (accessed 8 August 2011); da Silva, I.S., (2011) Climate change journalism: Govts, media urged to collaborate to 'save' the world., , http://www.bizcommunity.com/Print.aspx?l=196&c=15&ct=l&ci=60767, (accessed 11 August 2011); du Plessis, M., (2011) Shell's denial that fracking can soil water is self-serving, , http://www.iol.co.za/business/business-news/shell-s-denial-that-fracking-can-soil-water-is-self-serving-1.1159122, (accessed 20 October 2011); Glenn, I., Media and the environment (2008) Media studies: Policy, management and media representation, pp. 360-378. , In, ed.

There has been a notable lack of dialogue between gender advocates in the global north and south, from policy and practice, governments and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This paper contributes to the debate on the shape of future action for gender equity in health, by uniquely bringing together the voices of disparate actors, first heard in a series of four seminars held during 2008 and 2009, involving almost 200 participants from 15 different country contexts. The series used (Feminist) Participatory Action Research (FPAR) methodology to create a productive dialogue on the developing theory around GM and the at times disconnected empirical experience of policy and practice. We analyse the debates and experiences shared at the seminar series using concrete, context specific examples from research, advocacy, policy and programme development perspectives, as presented by participants from southern and northern settings, including Kenya, Mozambique, India, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Canada and Australia.Focussing on key discussions around sexualities and (dis)ability and their interactions with gender, we explore issues around intersectionality across the five key themes for research and action identified by participants: 1) Addressing the disconnect between gender mainstreaming praxis and contemporary feminist theory; 2) Developing appropriate analysis methodologies; 3) Developing a coherent theory of change; 4) Seeking resolution to the dilemmas and uncertainties around the 'place' of men and boys in GM as a feminist project; and 5) Developing a politics of intersectionality. We conclude that there needs to be a coherent and inclusive strategic direction to improve policy and practice for promoting gender equity in health which requires the full and equal participation of practitioners and policy makers working alongside their academic partners. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Disability; Gender; Global North; Global south; India; International health; Intersectionality; Mainstreaming; Sexuality","action research; disability; feminism; gender issue; health policy; health status; nongovernmental organization; participatory approach; sexuality; Africa; article; feminism; gender; gender equality; gender mainstreaming; health disparity; health program; health promotion; human; India; intersectionality; medical research; methodology; participatory research; politics; program development; public health; sexuality; social disability; social justice; Community-Based Participatory Research; Congresses as Topic; Female; Feminism; Great Britain; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Internationality; Male; Organizations; Sex Factors; World Health; Australia; Canada; Democratic Republic Congo; India; Kenya; Mozambique",,,,,"RWJF; ESRC: RES-451-26-0603","Aasen, B., (2006) Lessons from evaluations of women and gender equality in development cooperation, , Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional research (NIBR) Synthesis Report 2006/1, NORAD; Annandale, E., Kuhlmann, E., Gender and health care: the future (2010) The Palgrave handbook of gender and healthcare, pp. 454-469. , Palgrave, Basingstoke, E.

Urban politics, at least in these three theories, is the domain of big actors and big institutions: politicians, bureaucrats, large administrative agencies, behind-the-scenes business elites, developers and construction companies, housing corporations, and pressure groups of all stripes. The one constant in this pluralist give and take is that urban policy pays heed to the requirements of a favourable business climate and, following currently popular neoliberal claims of irresistible pressures for change, to globalization and the escalating competition between 'global cities' (Lindblom 1977; Judge 1995, 28; Dryzek, 1996; Sassen 2001; Fainstein 2010). In this hard-nosed game there is hardly any room for the influence of citizens. They either sporadically combine in associations to exert pressure on specific issues or are largely indifferent to politics (Harding 1995, 43). Citizens do play a central role in another chapter of urban theory: the informal city. Informality is a key concept in theories of planning that concern themselves with urbanization. Informality refers to 'informal modes of organizing space, livelihood and citizenship' (Roy 2010). It is usually associated with hyper-urbanization in the Global South, and it has been most extensively studied in these contexts (Roy 2003; Corbridge et al. 2005; Simone and Abouhani 2005; Chatterjee 2006; Holston 2008). In the absence of state institutions that are sufficiently strong to provide essential services to the poor, the latter have to rely on their own practical skills to create such services. Born of necessity, informality also contains hope however. Informality becomes the expression of another kind of urban politics, a 'deep democracy', a 'countergovernmentality' (Chatterjee 2006) that, informed by local knowledge of the conditions and experiences of the poor, allows them to construct an alternative 'insurgent' citizenship that destabilizes 'entrenched' forms of citizenship (Holston, 2008). © Cambridge University Press 2014.",,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,,,,,9781107296954; 9781107056107,,,"English","Practices of Freedom: Decentred Gov., Confl. and Democratic Participation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923470280
